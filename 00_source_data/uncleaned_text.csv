While patient management aims to reduce pain and improve daily function, prescription of opioids  remains widespread despite significant adverse effects. This study pooled data from two large  prospective trials on 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation (10 kHz SCS) in subjects with chronic low back pain  and/or leg pain and performed post hoc analysis on changes in opioid dosage 12 months post 10 kHz  SCS treatment. Patient-reported back and leg pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) and opioid  dose (milligrams morphine equivalent/day, MME/day) were compared at 12 months post-10 kHz SCS  therapy to baseline. Results showed that in the combined dataset, 39.3% of subjects were taking >90  MME dose of opioids at baseline compared to 23.0% at 12 months post-10 kHz SCS therapy (p = 0.007).  The average dose of opioids in >90 MME group was significantly reduced by 46% following 10 kHz  SCS therapy (p < 0.001), which was paralleled by significant pain relief (P < 0.001). In conclusion,  current analysis demonstrates the benefits of 10 kHz SCS therapy and offers an evidence-based, non- pharmaceutical alternative to opioid therapy and/or an adjunctive therapy to facilitate opioid dose  reduction whilst delivering significant pain relief. Healthcare providers involved in management of  chronic non-cancer pain can include reduction or elimination of opioid use as part of treatment plan  when contemplating 10 kHz SCS. Chronic pain, defined as pain that remains beyond normal healing time, is a debilitating group of conditions and  a prominent cause of disability worldwide1. While acute pain is generally nociceptive pain associated with soma- tosensory stimuli, chronic pain is thought to involve a shift from peripheral damage to more prominent central  sensitization and central nervous system mechanisms2. In general, the worldwide prevalence of chronic pain in  developed nations is around 20% and can be grouped into seven etiologies: primary pain that is not explained  by another pain condition, cancer pain, neuropathic pain, posttraumatic and postsurgical pain, musculoskeletal  pain, visceral pain and headache and orofacial pain3–7. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most prevalent  types of chronic pain; it is the leading global cause of disability, one of the common reasons for visits to physician’s  office, correlates with work absence and is therefore associated with significant economic costs8–13. Management of CLBP, like other chronic pain conditions, aims to reduce pain and improve daily function.  If non-pharmacological options such as bed rest, superficial heat, cryotherapy, exercise and physiotherapy are  unsuccessful, pharmacological therapies are a second-line option8,12,14. Of these, opioids are amongst the most  commonly prescribed drugs for low back pain15, yet their use remains controversial16. Limited head-to-head evi- dence suggests opioids to be more effective than naproxen or placebo for relieving CLBP17,18, but the average effect  is little more than a 10-mm reduction on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), a decrease that is not considered  1The Pain Management and Neuromodulation Centre, Guy’s and St. Thomas’ Hospital, London, UK. 2Multidisciplinary  Pain Centre, AZ Nikolaas, St Niklaas, Belgium. 3Nevro Corp. 1800 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City, CA, USA. 4Panwar  Health, Sydney, NSW, 2036, Australia. 5IPM Medical Group, Inc., Walnut Creek, California, USA. 6Carolina’s Pain  Institute, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.

In addition, opioids have well-described short and long-term side effects such  as constipation, nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, hormonal imbalance, changes in  immune response and physical dependence; opioid overdose deaths are mainly due to acute respiratory depres- sion caused by opioids21–23. Moreover, opioid use for chronic pain conditions like CLBP can cause tolerance,  hyperalgesia, misuse, abuse and diversion24–27. Therefore, international guidelines agree that opioids need to be  cautiously prescribed and should be discontinued if the benefits do not outweigh risks28. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines on using opioids for  management of chronic pain and capped the maximum opioid dose at 90 milligrams morphine equivalent  (MME)/day as the risk of abuse and misuse rises with higher doses29. Even at doses ≥50 MME/day, the risk of  death from opioid overdose is doubled30. The challenge for patients and prescribers is for patients taking ≥90  MME/day, the CDC recommends other approaches to pain management and a taper and discontinue approach  for the opioid29. However, no definite alternatives are recommended. Therefore, for improved quality of life, patients may desire and benefit from a reduction in opioid usage just as  much as they seek relief from chronic pain through additional treatment options that enable them to achieve both  goals. A minimally invasive alternative to opioid therapy is spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a type of neuromodu- lation typically used to treat chronic intractable neuropathic pain conditions like failed back surgery syndrome  (FBSS)31. With SCS, the painful region is stimulated using electrical pulses and the transmission of abnormal  pain signals to the brain is altered31. Stimulation is generally provided through electrode arrays placed into the  epidural space percutaneously, or through a surgical paddle lead delivered via a laminotomy. First generation SCS  devices generally deliver pulse frequencies between 40 to 60 Hz with the intent of replacing the pain sensation  with a stimulation-produced sensation known as paresthesia31,32. However, it is challenging to produce reliable  and tolerable paresthesis in the axial back region33. For this reason, it’s use has been largely limited to leg pain.  Moreover, some patients report paresthesia as an unpleasant sensation34 and the perceived intensity of paresthesia  can increase with body movement35. Another challenge of previous devices and new iterations of these devices  is providing durable pain relief for back and leg pain. Multiple studies demonstrated that approximately 50% of  the patients achieve ≥50% pain relief with traditional SCS and even in the patients who respond initially, therapy  effectiveness was found to diminish with time36–44. More recently, SCS has evolved into a variety of different modalities. One of these is 10 kHz SCS therapy  that applies a 10,000 Hz waveform and provides paresthesia-free pain relief31,45–47. Its use has been approved for  patients with chronic refractory pain of the trunk and/or limbs and is particularly suitable for CLBP.31,45,48,49.  Two studies described previously (SENZA-EU and SENZA-RCT) showed 10 kHz SCS therapy relieves low back  pain and leg pain for up to 24 months post-implant50,51. Compared to traditional SCS, 10 kHz SCS demonstrated  superior pain relief as well as long-term improvement in quality of life in subjects with leg pain and/or CLBP51,52. Despite their increasing use, to date there has been limited investigation on the role of SCS in facilitating a  reduction or elimination of opioids in chronic pain management53. Prospective studies have shown that tradi- tional SCS can reduce reliance on medication for management of pain. In a randomized controlled trial, North et  al. reported that 87% (20/23) of FBSS patients in the SCS group were either stably using opioids or decreased their  opioid use and only 13% (3/23) patients needed to increase their use of opioids whereas 58% (15/26) patients had  a stable or decreased opioid use and 42% (11/26) patients required increased opioid use in reoperation group37.  The results were further supported by systematic reviews on safety and efficacy of SCS for chronic pain including  CLBP and FBSS, which reported stable or reduced medication usage in 65% and 53% patients treated with SCS  respectively41,54. However, the definition of medication included opioid as well as non-opioid drugs in both stud- ies and so far, to our knowledge, no chronic pain SCS study has assessed reduction in opioid dose as the primary  endpoint and none have explored the ≥90 MME high-risk category. This post hoc analysis of the SENZA-EU and SENZA-RCT studies examines the effect of 10 kHz SCS therapy  on opioid analgesic pain management in the ≥90 MME high-risk category for subjects with leg pain and/or low  back pain. This analysis will determine if 10 kHz SCS therapy may facilitate successful reduction of opioids in  subjects taking the ≥90 MME doses for management of chronic pain in routine clinical practice. Results Patient demographics.  In SENZA-RCT, 89 subjects were successfully included through 12 months and in  SENZA-EU, 68 subjects were included through 12 months. Out of the subjects with pain relief data, 83 subjects  in SENZA-RCT and 54 subjects in SENZA-EU (137 subjects in the combined population) had opioid usage  data at baseline or 12-month assessment. They were included in initial analyses of demographics and clinical  characteristics. As listed in Tables 1, 60.2% subjects were female in SENZA-RCT, 53.7% in SENZA-EU and 57.7% in com- bined dataset. The average age of the combined population was 51.8 ± 11.7 years (mean ± standard deviation  [SD]) and the mean duration since diagnosis was 11.3 ± 9.5 years. Majority of subjects reported having previous  back surgery (85.4%) and were diagnosed with FBSS (81.8%). Due to minor differences in inclusion criteria  between SENZA-EU and SENZA-RCT studies, such as requirement of back pain with VAS score ≥5 cm regard- less of leg pain in the former study and requirement of both back and leg pain VAS scores ≥5 cm in the latter  study, the baseline average back pain VAS score (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM])was 1 cm higher than  SENZA-EU study (8.4 ± 0.2 cm compared with 7.5 ± 0.1 cm), while the average leg pain score was 2 cm lower  (5.1 ± 0.4 cm compared with 7.1 ± 0.2 cm). In the combined dataset, 39.5% of subjects were taking >90 MME  dose of opioids prior to 10 kHz SCS treatment; 48.0% in SENZA-RCT and 27.8% in SENZA-EU. Mean opioid reduction.  Further analyses on mean opioid reduction, reduction in pain intensity scores  and classification of subjects based on opioid dose were carried out in subjects with information on opioid dose.  At baseline, dose information was available in 75 subjects in SENZA-RCT, 54 subjects in SENZA-EU and 129  3 Scientific RepoRtS |         (2019) 9:11441  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-47792-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ subjects in the combined dataset (Fig. 1). At 12-month follow-up, dose information was available in 68 subjects in  SENZA-RCT, 54 subjects in SENZA-EU and 122 subjects in the combined data set (Fig. 1). As illustrated in Fig. 2, though the primary endpoint of the studies was pain scores and opioid reduction  was not emphasized in the study, decreases in opioid dosage were noted in the subjects following 10 kHz SCS  treatment. In both studies, there was a reduction in the mean opioid dose 12-months following 10 kHz SCS ther- apy compared with baseline (Fig. 2A). In the combined dataset, there was a 41.0% reduction (p < 0.001) in the  mean opioid dose at 12 months from 104.2 ± 9.0 MME (N = 129) to 61.4 ± 6.9 MME (N = 122). Separately, in  the SENZA-EU study, the mean opioid dose at 12 months post-10 kHz SCS therapy significantly reduced from  92.3 ± 15.6 MME (N = 54) to 28.1 ± 6.0 MME (N = 54, p < 0.001). Whereas in the SENZA-RCT study, the mean  opioid dose significantly decreased from 112.7 ± 10.5 MME (N = 75) to 87.9 ± 10.3 MME (N = 68) at 12 months  post-10 kHz SCS therapy (p < 0.001). Pain response.  When the studies were compared for pain reduction following 10 kHz SCS therapy, there  were significant reductions in pain relief (VAS score) across both back and leg pain (Fig. 2B, p < 0.001). Overall  in the combined dataset, there was a 67.9% reduction in back pain from 7.8 ± 0.1 cm (N = 129) to 2.5 ± 0.2 cm  (N = 122) and 68.2% reduction in leg pain from 6.3 ± 0.2 cm (N = 129) to 2.0 ± 0.2 cm (N = 122) reported by  subjects that were opioid users at 12 months post-10 kHz SCS therapy compared with baseline. Proportion of subjects and mean MME.  Changes in medication and opioid doses (MME) are shown in  Table 2 and Fig. 3. In the combined dataset at 12 months post-10 kHz SCS therapy, 27.0% (N = 33/122) of subjects  were taking no opioids, 23.0% (N = 28/122) of subjects were on >90 MME compared with only 1.6% (N = 2/129)  and 39.5% (N = 51/129) at baseline, respectively (Fig. 3E, p < 0.0001). Across all doses in both SENZA-EU  and SENZA-RCT, there was a significant shift towards lower MMEs following 10 kHz SCS treatment (Fig. 3C,  p = 3.9 × 10−7 and Fig. 3A, p = 0.046 respectively). Proportion of subjects ≤90 and >90 MME.  Figure 3B,D,F show the proportion of subjects in doses  ≤90 MME and >90 MME categories. Overall there was a significant reduction in the percentage of subjects on  high-risk MME doses >90 in the combined dataset (Fig. 3F, p = 0.007). Changes in opioid dose in subjects in high-risk category (>90 MME).  Subjects taking >90 MME  of opioids at baseline were then studied further for changes in opioid dose following 10 kHz SCS therapy. At base- line, 36 subjects in SENZA-RCT, 15 subjects in SENZA-EU and 51 subjects in the combined dataset were taking  >90 MME of opioids for management of pain (Fig. 1). Across both studies, within the high-risk category (>90  MME) there was a trend towards a reduced opioid dose in most individual subjects 12 months post-10 kHz SCS  therapy (Fig. 4A). Twelve out of 15 subjects in SENZA-EU and 11 out of 36 subjects in SENZA-RCT were able to  cease or reduce their opioid dose to ≤90 MME at 12 months. Despite more subjects remaining on lower MMEs of  opioids compared to baseline, significant pain reduction was reported across both studies following 10 kHz SCS  therapy. As shown in Fig. 4B, following 10 kHz SCS therapy, subjects initially on >90 MME dose of opioids at  baseline reported a 72.4% reduction in back pain from 8.7 ± 0.3 cm (N = 15) to 2.4 ± 0.6 cm (N = 15) and 72.0%  reduction in leg pain from 5.0 ± 0.8 cm (N = 15) to 1.4 ± 0.5 cm (N = 15) in SENZA-EU and a 68.9% reduction in  back pain from 7.4 ± 0.2 cm (N = 36) to 2.3 ± 0.3 cm (N = 36) and 73.6% reduction in leg pain from 7.2 ± 0.3 cm  (N = 36) to 1.9 ± 0.3 cm (N = 36) in SENZA-RCT. Mean opioid reduction in high-risk category (>90 MME).  For subjects on high doses of opioids prior  to treatment (>90 MME), in the combined dataset, 12 months post-10 kHz SCS therapy resulted in a 45.9%  reduction in the mean opioid dose at follow-up from 196.8 ± 14.2 to 106.5 ± 14.1 (N = 51 for both baseline and  follow-up, Fig. 5A, p < 0.0001). In these subjects, significant reductions in both back and leg pain were recorded,  with subjects reporting on average a 70.5% reduction in back pain and 73.8% reduction in leg pain at 12 months  (N = 51 for both baseline and follow-up, Fig. 5B, both p < 0.001).

Mortality rates associated with prescription opioid-related  addiction and overdose have surpassed motor-vehicle accidents and patients with Human Immunodeficiency  Virus, affecting people from all socio-economic classes55. Clear evidence is now available that demonstrates the  rate of overdose of prescription opioids is directly proportional to the prescribed dose56. Despite efforts from reg- ulatory bodies and clinical guidelines, opioids continue to be prescribed for patients with chronic pain conditions.  In 2016, the CDC released its guideline on prescribing opioids for chronic pain and recommended avoiding or  carefully justifying doses of above 90 MME29. Patients who do not achieve adequate pain relief and function at  this dose are advised to seek alternative pain management options29. This recommendation received widespread  criticism for its lack of guidance on suitable alternative options, leaving prescribers and patients with a dilemma  regarding how to manage pain57. Patients are feeling left without options, and their quality of life is suffering as a  consequence58. Despite clear guidance on maximum doses of opioids and the rationale for high-dose opioids becoming  weaker, patients continue to rely on doses > 90 MME for pain management. A recent retrospective analysis of  1,066 primary health care records of patients prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, 9.7% were receiving  Figure 1. Study flow diagram showing patient datasets used for analyses. 5 Scientific RepoRtS |         (2019) 9:11441  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-47792-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ≥90 MME59. In 2012, the CDC reported that 10% of patients on prescription opioids were receiving a high-dose  (>100 MME) from one doctor, and of those who overdosed, 40% were also prescribed their pain relief from a  single doctor29. Surveys have reported that 70% of long-term opioid users suffer from a chronic disease or disa- bility which limits their daily function29,60. Assuming 10% of these patients may be on high-doses to maintain an  adequate level of function and pain relief, feasible alternative options are required to reduce the risk of overdose.  Clearly, patients suffering from CLBP and leg pain need evidence-based, safe and effective alternatives to long  term opioid therapy. In the current study, patients had CLBP and leg pain for an average of 11.3 ±0.8 years. They experienced  significant baseline pain, despite being managed by prescription opioid therapy. Over a third (39.3%) of subjects  were taking > 90 MME of opioids at baseline. 10 kHz SCS therapy was successful in reducing the mean opioid  dose and patient reported pain at 12 months. Figure 2 shows following 10 kHz SCS therapy, the mean dose was  reduced below 90 MME to 61.4 MME in the combined dataset. Despite a substantial reduction in the mean opioid  dose, 10 kHz SCS therapy significantly improved patient-reported back and leg pain at the 12-month follow-up. Not only was 10 kHz SCS therapy able to reduce the overall dose of opioids used by subjects with CLBP and leg  pain, it reduced the proportion of subjects requiring high-risk doses >90 MME per day at the same time. Figure 3  shows in both studies fewer subjects remained on >90 MME per day, and more subjects were able to withdraw  their opioid altogether following 10 kHz SCS therapy. In the combined dataset, nearly 80% of the subjects were  now on dosing range associated with a reduced risk doses of opioids, with over 20% shifting from >90 MME to  <90 MME at follow-up. The dose reduction was observed across individual subjects, as shown in Fig. 4, with  most of them demonstrating a reduction in dose at 12 months. A reduction in pain with a reduction in opioid  dose is a clinically important finding, demonstrating 10 kHz SCS therapy is not only an alternative to opioid ther- apy, regardless of high- or low-dose, it is able to provide more effective pain relief than baseline opioid therapy. Interestingly, compared to SENZA-RCT, higher reductions in opioid dose and higher proportion of sub- jects taking lower doses of opioids at 12 months were observed in the SENZA-EU study. There may be multi- ple factors contributing to these observed differences. While SENZA-EU was a prospective, single-arm study  designed to assess the efficacy of 10 kHz SCS system, SENZA-RCT was a randomized controlled trial designed  to compare 10 kHz SCS with traditional SCS in order to support regulatory approval. Thus, the SENZA-RCT  was highly focused on pain management rather than opioid reduction, whereas more emphasis was placed on  weaning SENZA-EU subjects off of opioids. In SENZA-RCT, subjects were allowed to continue on stable doses  of opioids but were considered as treatment failures regardless of pain scores (VAS) if they increased opioid  dose. Related, there were also differences in pain management practice between study centers in SENZA-EU  Figure 2.

Investigators from SENZA-EU study actively encouraged the subjects to titrate and taper their  opioid dose, whereas investigators from SENZA-RCT did not actively encourage opioid reduction. Lastly, chronic  pain patients who are on long term opioids but still have high pain scores underscores the observation that opi- oids seem to have little benefit in improving chronic pain, especially as measured by VAS, yet are difficult to dis- continue. Over the past decade, especially in the US, patients remained on opioids despite their dubious clinical  benefit. This may have translated into clinical management changes that were not part of the goals of the RCT or  EU studies. In the past few years, several studies have documented lack of clinically relevant efficacy with the use of opi- oids for chronic non-cancer pain and highlighted the harmful side effects of using opioids61–67. The CDC guide- lines published in 2016, recommended caution when increasing the opioid doses above 50 MME and avoiding  opioid doses above 90 MME29. To prescribe safe doses of opioids and to wean the chronic pain patients off opi- oids, pain management specialists need durable alternatives for management of chronic pain. The current find- ings indicate that 10 kHz SCS can be considered as an alternative to opioids. A case-controlled retrospective  study by researchers from Boston, USA showed that opioid usage was reduced or eliminated in 71% (n = 15/21)  of patients treated with 10 kHz SCS for back and/or leg pain68. Another retrospective study by pain management  specialist from Perth, Australia showed that percentage of patients not taking opioids increased nearly 2-fold  Figure 3.

More importantly, average opioid dose in patients taking high dose opioids at baseline was  reduced by 47% at last follow-up69. Current study further confirms the findings from the retrospective studies and  shows that 10 kHz SCS can provide long-lasting pain relief and allow reduction or elimination of opioids even in  patients who were prescribed high-risk doses. Pain physicians need to take note of the findings from the studies  and encourage patients treated with 10 kHz SCS to discontinue opioids. They need to include reduction or elim- ination of opioid use as part of treatment plan when contemplating 10 kHz SCS. Establishing opioid reduction as  part of the treatment goal even prior to the trial could help in setting up expectations and result in meaningful  improvement in quality of life. The main limitation of this study is that it involved post hoc analysis of the dataset and there was no prospec- tively defined statistical analysis plan (SAP) for predetermined outcomes. Although the combined dataset in the  study included 129 subjects with opioid dose information, there were differences between the two studies and the  number of subjects taking > 90 MME was relatively small. Additional prospective studies and real-world studies  may be needed to validate the findings of this analysis. Nevertheless, current analysis shows that despite the dif- ferences between the two studies and the patient cohorts, 10 kHz SCS therapy resulted in significant reduction in  opioid dosage while maintaining pain relief when the data was analysed individually and when combined.

Methods SENZA-EU.  As described previously, SENZA-EU was a prospective, multicentre, open-label study in 83 sub- jects conducted at two European centers including AZ Nikolaas Pain Centre, St Niklaas Belgium and Guy’s and St  Thomas’ Pain and Neuromodulation Centre, London, United Kingdom50. The study protocol and informed con- sent forms were approved by each study site’s ethic committee (Commissie voor Medische Ethiek AZ Nikolaas,  Belgium and NRES Northern & Yorkshire REC, UK respectively). Local clinical research and data protection  regulations, good clinical practice guidelines (ISO 14155), and the Declaration of Helsinki were followed during  the study. Selection bias in the study was minimized by the involvement of independent medical monitors, which  assured high level diligence for the recruitment of subjects. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment of  patients has been previously reported50. Briefly, patients who signed informed consent forms, with chronic back  pain (defined as lumbo-sacral pain) with or without leg pain with pain intensity of ≥5.0 cm (average score over  the last 30 days) on the 0 to 10 cm, visual analog scale (VAS), who were ≥18 years of age and who were candi- dates for SCS were included in the study. Patients were evaluated at baseline and then received a trial 10 kHz SCS  (Senza® SCS system Nevro Corp., Redwood City, CA, USA) therapy for 14–30 days50. Patients who had at least  50% reduction in pain intensity received a permanent IPG implant and followed for 24 months with assessments  at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months50. Subjects were enrolled in the study between August 2009 and February 2011.  The follow-up for the last implanted patient was completed in April 2013. The study design allowed adjustment  of stimulation parameters and clinical judgement-based adjustment to pain medication dosage throughout the  follow-up period50. SENZA-RCT.  SENZA-RCT was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in 198 patients across 10 centers  in the U.S., designed to assess 10 kHz SCS therapy as compared with traditional low frequency SCS51. The study  was conducted in compliance with the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations and recommendations guiding physi- cians in biomedical research by the 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki, Finland. The study protocol and  informed consent forms were approved by each study site’s institutional review board (Western Institutional  Review Board, Puyallup, Washington; Forsyth Medical Center Institutional Review Board, Winston-Salem, North  Carolina). Selection bias in the study was addressed by the involvement of independent medical monitors for the  recruitment of subjects and randomized assignment of subjects to the 10 kHz SCS group. Patients who signed  informed consent forms and were candidates for SCS with chronic, intractable back and/or leg pain, refractory  to conservative therapy for a minimum of 3 months with an average back pain intensity of 5 or greater out of  10 cm on the VAS, average leg pain intensity of 5 or greater out of 10 cm on the VAS, an Oswestry Disability Index  (ODI) score of 41 to 80 out of 100 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive stimulation with an investigational  10 kHz SCS therapy system (Senza® System; Nevro Corp., Redwood City, USA) or a commercially available SCS  system (Precision Plus System; Boston Scientific, USA)51. Patients underwent a percutaneous trial lasting up to 14  days51. Those with ≥40% back pain reduction from baseline proceeded to permanent implantation and subjects  with at least 50% pain reduction were considered as ‘responders’51. Subjects were enrolled between June 2012  and December 2012. Following randomization, subjects were implanted with 10 kHz SCS system and followed  through 12 months, which concluded in February 2014. Oral analgesics were stabilized from 28 days before  Figure 5.

Adjustments were then allowed under the guidance of a study investigator as medically necessary, but the subjects  who increased their opioid dose were considered as ‘non-responders’ regardless of their pain relief51. Assessments  were performed at scheduled visits (baseline; 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months)51. Data from subjects implanted with  10 kHz SCS system was included in the current analysis. Outcomes.  Both studies, SENZA-RCT and SENZA-EU assessed back and leg pain intensity as patient  reported VAS (0 to 10 cm, no pain-to-worst pain imaginable) at baseline and 12 months. Opioid medication  dose was assessed in both studies at baseline and 12 months as (milligrams morphine equivalent, MME) and the  changes in opioid consumption were recorded as “eliminated”, “decreased”, “no change” or “increased”. The assess- ments were comparable between the studies and therefore it was possible to combine the data from the studies. Data collection and statistical analysis.  Demographic analyses were performed in the implanted  patients with data at 12 months and with basic information on opioid usage (Fig. 1). Further analyses such as  mean pain intensity (VAS), mean dose of opioids (MME) and categorization of subjects based on opioid dose  were performed only in data from patients with opioid dose information. Information on opioid dose was lost to  follow-up at 12-month assessment in 7 subjects from SENZA-RCT study. The missing subjects were included in  the calculation of mean, SEM and categorization based on opioid dose at baseline and were excluded from anal- yses at 12-month assessment. Two-tailed paired t-test was used for continuous variables, such as VAS and mean  opioid dose and Chi-square test and Fischer’s exact test for comparison of the frequency of proportions between  two groups. P-value less than or equal to 5% (p < 0.05) was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical  analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (paired t-test) and Graph Pad (Chi-square test and Fischer’s exact  test) software.

However, large observational studies have yet to be published. Therefore, we performed a real-world, mul- ticenter, retrospective, review of therapy efﬁcacy in 1660 patients with chronic trunk and/or limb pain. Methods: Data were collected in a real- world environment and retrospectively sourced from a global database. Included patients were trialed and/or permanently implanted with HF-SCS at 10 kHz between April 2014 and January 2018. We evaluated responder rates at 3, 6, and 12 months post-implantation. Response was deﬁned as ≥50% pain relief from baseline. A last visit analysis included responder rate along with overall change in function, sleep, quality of life, and medication intake versus baseline. Results: Eighty-four percent of our HF-SCS-treated patients had both chronic back and leg pain. At least 70% of patients reported response to therapy throughout 12 months of follow-up. This sustained responder rate was corroborated by the last visit value (74.1%). Most patients reported concomitant improvements in function (72.3%), sleep (68.0%), and quality of life (90.3%) at their last visit versus baseline. Thirty- two percent of patients reported decreased medication intake at their last visit. Interpretation: Sustained and effective pain relief was experienced by >70% of our HF-SCS-treated patients, consistent with the ﬁndings of a pre- viously published randomized, controlled, trial. Our review provides comple- mentary evidence to support the treatment of chronic back and leg pain with this therapy. Introduction Chronic pain is a pervasive health issue worldwide.1,2 It places a substantial burden on society, families, and indi- viduals.3 Low back pain is one of the most prevalent chronic pain syndromes. It affects over 500 million peo- ple globally and is the largest single cause of years lived with disability.4 Persistent back and/or radicular leg pain secondary to spinal surgery, also known as failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), is quite a common condition 496 ª 2019 The Authors.

Interventional pain management specialists have used traditional low-frequency spinal cord stimulation (LF- SCS) to treat FBSS for several decades. Its effectiveness has been established in patients with predominant leg pain.7,8 It is generally accepted after decades of experience and research in this area that LF-SCS provides around 50% pain relief in approximately half of patients.9 While this is an overall success story for many patients with intractable pain, the therapy has key limitations. Half of patients do not achieve satisfactory pain control, and for many that do initially, long-term studies suggest that therapy effectiveness can diminish after several years.10–15 Achieving good outcomes in patients with predominant axial back pain is especially challenging.16 In addition, the necessary paresthesia which characterizes successful LF- SCS is uncomfortable for some patients, particularly if they experience overstimulation during postural changes.17,18 New stimulation waveforms offer the opportunity to improve clinical outcomes and provide a more comfort- able patient experience. High-frequency spinal cord stim- ulation (HF-SCS) at 10 kHz has proven to do both. In an RCT, the therapy was compared with LF-SCS in subjects with chronic back and leg pain.19 At 24 months after implantation, for both back and leg pain, approximately half of LF-SCS subjects were responders to therapy (at least 50% pain relief from baseline), while around three- quarters were responders to HF-SCS at 10 kHz. Over- and-above the long-term superiority over LF-SCS, sub- jects receiving HF-SCS at 10 kHz did not experience any paresthesia or stimulation-related discomfort.20 Within the clinical evidence hierarchy, randomized, controlled, trials are the gold-standard study design to minimize bias and confounding factors.21 Their goal is to generate, as far as is reasonably possible within the study setting and design, credible evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between a treatment and an outcome in a target population. The role of RCTs is well-established and central to the practice of evidence-based medicine. However, while the validity of RCTs can be high within their target population, their external validity may be lim- ited by strict patient selection, limited duration, and rig- orous clinical protocols.21–23 A closer reﬂection of everyday clinical practice may be accomplished using pragmatic observational studies. Although such studies cannot infer causal relationships, they can produce com- plementary evidence to validate the outcomes of RCTs.23 In the case of HF-SCS at 10 kHz, results from observa- tional studies in large groups of patients have yet to be published. Therefore, we performed a real-world, multi- center, retrospective, review of the efﬁcacy of this therapy in 1660 patients with chronic trunk and/or limb pain. Methods Study design and setting Data for this international, retrospective, multicenter, review were drawn from a real-world, global, database populated with anonymized records from all included patients who were trialed and/or permanently implanted with a Senza TM system delivering HF-SCS at 10 kHz and maintained by Nevro Corp., Redwood City, CA, USA. Eight sites (both academic and non-academic centers) across three countries participated in this review. Each site had at least 100 implanted patients over a 2-year per- iod. Five sites were located in the USA, 2 in Germany, and 1 in the UK. Due to the retrospective nature of the analyses and use of anonymized data listings, ethical com- mittee approval was not required for this study. Selection criteria We retrospectively extracted and analyzed the database records from all trunk and/or limb pain patients in par- ticipating institutions who were trialed and/or perma- nently implanted with HF-SCS at 10 kHz between April 2014 and January 2018. Follow-up Trial and permanent implantation procedures for the therapy have been described previously.20 Aside from the standard of care clinical follow-ups, pre- and post- implantation patient management included the support of a local clinical specialist under the guidance of a pain physician. The principal role of the clinical specialist was to assess therapy effectiveness at each clinic visit via a ser- ies of structured questions and assist in carrying out ther- apy optimization, as necessary. If patients were not able to attend regular follow-up visits at 3, 6, 12 month and/ or last visit assessment after permanent implant they’ve been contacted by clinical specialist via telephone. Stan- dard programming strategies were followed for HF-SCS at 10 kHz based on patient-reported pain relief and included an electrode bipole search to determine the optimal stim- ulation site within the vertebral column, typically near thoracic vertebral levels 9 and 10. If needed, there were several additional therapy optimization tools available to evaluate more complex electrode combinations, pulse trains, and amplitude settings. Data were entered into the global database after each follow-up. ª 2019 The Authors.

Stauss et al. 10 kHz HF-SCS for Chronic Trunk and/or Limb Pain Variables Patient records were extracted from the database at numerous study time points including baseline, during the trial, and at each scheduled post-implantation follow- up. The last visit assessment was deﬁned as the last clinic or telephone follow-up with the patient at any time after permanent implantation, before the data were pooled for ﬁnal report. Baseline data comprised pain intensity score measured using an 11-point verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS; 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain), pain distribu- tion, and previous LF-SCS experience (if any). Data from the trial included pain intensity score (VNRS) and per- centage pain relief obtained from the therapy (0% = no pain relief to 100% = complete pain relief). The latter variable was also extracted from each post-implantation follow-up. From the last visit, variables were extracted relating to the usage of additional therapy optimization tools (10 kHz preferred program), overall change in medication (increased, decreased, or unchanged), function (improved: yes or no), and sleep (improved: yes or no). In USA, additional variables relating to overall change in quality of life (a great deal better, moderately better, or no change), satisfaction with therapy, device recharge experi- ence, frequency of therapy adjustments, and device usage while sleeping and driving were extracted. All variables were patient-reported except those relating to therapy optimization. Therapy response was evaluated from the percentage pain relief documented during the trial, at each scheduled post-implantation follow-up, and at the last visit. Response to therapy was deﬁned as at least 50% pain relief from baseline. Statistical methods Descriptive analysis of continuous variables included median, 25th (Q1) and 75th (Q3) percentiles. Categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) where possible. Pain relief data were analyzed by reporting descriptive statistics. As an additional supportive analysis, last visit data were eval- uated. All data were analyzed as-observed. Outcomes from this cohort relating to overall change in quality of life, satisfaction with therapy, device recharge experience, frequency of therapy adjustments, and device usage while sleeping and driving were also compared to available commercial data from all implanted patients in USA. These anonymized data were collected in the real-world setting and stored in the global database. In addition, selected outcomes were further analyzed in the subgroup of patients with previously unsuccessful LF-SCS. The number of patients with available data is reported for each measure. All analyses were carried out in Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Results Patient cohort During the 4-year review period, 1660 patients were tri- aled and/or permanently implanted with HF-SCS at 10 kHz at participating institutions (Fig. 1). Of these, 1603 had percentage pain relief trial data available and were analyzed for therapy response. The same data were available for 844, 600, and 326 patients, at 3, 6, and 12 months post-implantation, respectively, and for 1131 patients at the last visit. As the data were collected in a real-world setting, only a fraction of patients had infor- mation at 3, 6, and 12 months, whereas majority had information at last visit assessment. The mean time between implantation and the last visit was 8.9 months (SD �6.7, median 6.9, range 0.1–33.2). Patient characteristics Baseline patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Pain distribution data were available for 1640 patients. Of these, 43.5% reported back and leg pain, 27.4% predomi- nant back pain, and 12.6% predominant leg pain. Upper back, left arm, and right arm constituted the three main other pain distributions (16.5%). Approximately a quarter of patients (23.9%, N = 1596) had been unsuccessfully treated with LF-SCS in the past. Median pain intensity score for the cohort (N = 1603) was 8.0 (Q1–Q3, 7.0–9.0). Pain distribution was slightly, but signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.002, chi-square test) between patients included from Europe (N = 479) and the USA (N = 1161) (Table 1). Brieﬂy, of the patients with available pain dis- tribution data, 39.7% in Europe and 45.0% in the USA reported back and leg pain, 24.6% and 28.6% predomi- nant back pain, and 14.8% and 11.7% predominant leg pain, respectively, and 20.5% in Europe and 25.2% in the USA had been unsuccessfully treated with LF-SCS in the past. Median pain intensity scores for patients included from Europe and the USA were 9.0 (Q1–Q3, 8.0–9.5) and 8.0 (Q1–Q3, 7.0–9.0), respectively. Outcomes Pain relief and responder rate At the end of trial time point, 86.9% of all patients (1393/1603) responded to therapy (at least 50% pain 498 ª 2019 The Authors.

Stauss et al. relief from baseline). Trial responders reported a signiﬁ- cant (P < 0.00001, Mann–Whitney U test) reduction in pain intensity scores, with median scores reduced from 8.0 (Q1–Q3, 7.0–9.0) to 3.0 (Q1–Q3, 1.0–4.0), a reduc- tion of 62.5%. Furthermore, pain intensity scores (VNRS) were signiﬁcantly lower at all time points (P < 0.00001, Mann–Whitney U test) compared to baseline in the responding patients. Median pain intensity score decreased from 8.0 (Q1–Q3, 7.0–9.0) to 3.0 (Q1–Q3, 2.0– 4.0), 3.0 (Q1–Q3, 2.0–4.0), 3.0 (Q1–Q3, 2.0–4.0), and 3.0 (Q1–Q3, 2.0–4.0) at 3, 6, 12 months and the last visit, respectively. Of the 844 patients with percentage pain relief data available at 3 months post-implantation, 74.6% responded to therapy. This responder rate was sustained throughout 12 months post-implantation (Fig. 2) and was consistent with the last visit value of 74.1% (N = 1131). Responder rate was further analyzed accord- ing to whether patients were included from Europe or the USA. Though the responder rates appeared to be slightly Figure 1.

Safety Among the 1290 patients with safety data available, 48 had their devices explanted (3.7%) (Table 2). Of these, 22 were removed sequela to infection (1.7%), 15 due to loss of efﬁcacy (1.2%), and 11 for other reasons (0.8%). Ease of use While a high percentage of patients responded well to standard 10 kHz target optimization using a simple bipole, additional 10 kHz therapy optimization tools were utilized in 56.7% of all patients (N = 1198) (Fig. 3). These programming options were applied in a standard- ized fashion and customized to each patient’s needs. In total, 38.3% of all patients (N = 1198) had multi-area pain sequencing (MAPS) or bipole interlacing pro- grammed. The former option combined different pro- grams while the latter merged multiple bipole programs into one program. Pulse dosing was programmed in 18.4% of the population (N = 1198) and delivered stimu- lation in on-off cycles. Interestingly, additional 10 kHz therapy optimization tools were utilised in 72.7% of patients from Europe (N = 391) and in 48.9% of patients from the USA (N = 807) (Fig. 3). More speciﬁcally, MAPS or bipole interlacing was programmed in 54.9% and 30.2% of Eur- ope and USA patients, respectively, while pulse dosing was programmed in 17.8% and 18.7%, respectively. Quality of life Functional improvement at the last visit was noted by 72.3% of all patients (N = 1088), 78.8% of Europe patients (N = 311), and 69.8% of USA patients (N = 777) (Fig. 3). Improved sleep was reported by 68.0% of all patients (N = 1020), 68.5% of Europe patients (N = 286), and 67.8% of USA patients (N = 734). Additional responses to questions at the last visit which evaluated overall change in quality of life, satisfaction with therapy, device recharge experience, frequency of therapy adjustments, and device usage while sleeping and driving are detailed in Table 3. Data were available for between 533 and 544 patients for all questions except that which focused on patients with previous LF-SCS experi- ence which had 60 responses. When questioned about overall change in quality of life, 90.3% of patients reported improvement. High levels of satisfaction with therapy were also reported by most patients: 82.4% were likely or very likely to undergo the procedure again for the same result, 89.5% were likely or very likely to recommend the therapy, and 95.0% of patients who had previous LF-SCS experience rated their HF-SCS at 10 kHz as better. Device recharging was found to be convenient in 86.4% of patients with the majority charging their device daily or every other day (94.1%) for about an hour or less (88.7%). Patients rarely adjusted their therapy more often than 2–3 times per week (2.2%). Nearly all patients slept and drove with their devices switched on (98.7% and 98.2%, respectively). The responses to this set of questions were generally in line with the commercial data from all implanted patients in USA (N = 8282; Table 3). Medication change Overall change in medication versus baseline was also analyzed at the last visit.

Patients with previous LF-SCS Outcomes were analyzed as they related to the subgroup of patients with previously unsuccessful LF-SCS. The results of HF-SCS in this patient subgroup were compara- ble to the results for the entire cohort. Pain distribution data (N = 382) indicated that 47.6% had back and leg pain, 26.7% predominant back pain, 10.7% predominant leg pain, and 14.9% other pain distributions. Median pain intensity score at baseline was 8.0 (Q–Q3, 7.0–9.0) (N = 337). The mean time between implantation and the last visit was 10.7 months (�7.7, range 0.1–33.2). Success- ful trials were reported in 88.4% of this group (298/337). Pain intensity scores in trial responders reduced signiﬁ- cantly (P < 0.0001, Mann–Whitney U test). Median scores reduced from 8.0 (Q1–Q3, 7.0–9.0) to 3.0 (Q1–Q3, 1.8–4.0) points, a reduction of 62.5%. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-implantation, 75.6% (N = 193), 72.1% (N = 147), and 78.9% (N = 90) of patients responded to therapy, respectively (Fig. 2). Of the 266 patients with percentage pain relief data available at the last visit, 74.1% responded to therapy. At the last visit, 32.5% of patients (N = 40) reported decreased medication intake versus baseline, 82.5% (N = 40) improved function, and 70.0% (N = 30) improved sleep. Responses to questions at the last visit which evaluated overall change in quality of life, satisfaction with therapy, device recharge experi- ence, frequency of therapy adjustments, and device usage while sleeping and driving were very similar to the whole cohort of patients (Table 3). Discussion This publication constitutes the most extensive study to date evaluating the real-world efﬁcacy of HF-SCS 10 kHz therapy for chronic back and/or limb pain. Data were ret- rospectively sourced from eight participating centers across three countries over a 4-year period. A total of 1660 patients were included in the review. The majority of the cohort had both chronic back and leg pain or axial back pain (71%), which are historically difﬁcult-to-treat pain syndromes. Our review found that >70% of our HF- SCS treated patients experienced at least 50% pain relief throughout 12 months of post-implantation follow-up. This outcome was corroborated by the last visit analysis. Concomitant improvements in quality of life, function, sleep, and medication reduction as well as high levels of satisfaction with the therapy were also reported. Therapeutic and device durability was found to be robust as evidenced by an extremely low explantation rate. The overall rate of system explant was 3.7%, far less than historical norms for traditional spinal cord stimula- tion (LF-SCS).24 Explants due to infection were 1.7% of implants. This value is slightly lower than the published historical rates of LF-SCS infection of 3-5%.25 Explants due to loss of efﬁcacy occurred in 1.2% of the implanted population. Behind battery depletion in non-rechargeable IPGs, explants due to loss of efﬁcacy are the predominant driver for historical LF-SCS explantations; thus, the low rates of explant for this reason are highly encouraging. There were no explants due to battery depletion. Figure 2. Responder rate (�95% conﬁdence interval) at each study time point. Table 2. Details of device explants in the population.

Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc on behalf of American Neurological Association. 10 kHz HF-SCS for Chronic Trunk and/or Limb Pain T. Stauss et al. Device recharging was generally found to be convenient with most patients recharging daily, or every other day for an hour or less. Paresthesia-independent stimulation is likely to account for the vast majority of patients (98% or more) who rarely adjusted their therapy settings once optimal pain relief was achieved, and reported sleeping and driving with their devices switched on. Our analysis also showed that therapy can be tailored to individual patients, with patients ﬁnding their most successful pro- gram across a range of different applications of 10 kHz therapy. Further subgroup analysis of patients with previ- ously unsuccessful LF-SCS revealed that their outcomes were very similar to the whole cohort, indicating that 10 kHz HF-SCS therapy may be a useful treatment option for this group. Our responder rate outcomes are consistent with results from a multicenter, prospective, randomized, con- trolled trial (SENZA-RCT) comparing the therapy with LF-SCS.19,20 Recruited subjects had chronic, intractable, back and leg pain with average pain intensity in both locations of at least 5.0 cm on the visual analog scale (VAS). The SENZA-RCT longitudinal responder rates for axial back pain in HF-SCS 10 kHz subjects were 84%, 76%, and 79% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The corresponding rates for overall pain relief in our cohort were comparable (Fig. 4). Furthermore, 32% of our patients reported decreased medication intake at their last visit. This proportion is in line with the 36% of subjects receiving HF-SCS 10 kHz in the SENZA-RCT who reduced or stopped opioid pain medication at 12 months.20 Overall, the patient populations in both studies were broadly similar in their primary indication of chronic back and leg pain. The Level I evidence provided by the SENZA-RCT has been strengthened by the contribution of our real-world data from a large cohort of patients across multiple international centers and is likely to reﬂect everyday clinical practice. The concomitant reduc- tion in medication consumption found in both studies is potentially beneﬁcial to patients as well as health care providers since it may reduce prescription costs and visits to pharmacy. Limitations of this review are related to the real-world setting and include its retrospective nature, lack of control group and use of non-standardized measures for out- comes such as sleep. Data were not entered systematically across all centers and some patients may have been included in early follow-ups, but not later ones, and vice- versa. Both factors resulted in an inhomogeneous data set with a declining patient number throughout follow-up. In addition, longitudinal data were available only for per- centage pain relief. All other post-implantation variables were collected during a single last visit assessment. The real-world setting also prevented the collection of speciﬁc pain etiologies and implantation details as well as stan- dardized measures of medication intake, quality of life, function, and sleep. For example, the simpliﬁed measures we used did not evaluate pain medication intake by class, quality of life parameters relating to health and physical or social activities, or assessment of sleep latency and quality. As such these results should be interpreted with caution. Figure 4. Comparison of responder rates (�95% conﬁdence interval) between this real-world study and the SENZA-RCT. ª 2019 The Authors.

Stauss et al. 10 kHz HF-SCS for Chronic Trunk and/or Limb Pain Other limitations relate to our data analysis. Evaluating data as-observed may overestimate response.26 In addi- tion, given the non-normal distribution of the data, non- parametric statistics with mixed model approach using study as a ﬁxed categorical factor and period as a repeated categorical ﬁxed factor may have been a better choice for longitudinal analysis of pain relief. However, because the data was collected in a real-world setting and completely anonymized, pain relief data in a speciﬁed line could not be attributed to a single subject. Therefore, it was not possible to apply mixed model approach and only descriptive statistics could be used to analyze the data. Data distribution should be borne in mind while interpreting these results. Furthermore, evaluation of out- comes in patients with previously unsuccessful LF-SCS requires a larger population of patients to allow adequate statistical analysis. Finally, there were methodological differences related to study design and patient characteristics regarding the comparison of our responder rates to those reported in the SENZA-RCT. For example, our study evaluated over- all pain relief rather than separate back and leg pain relief (derived from VAS) as measured in the SENZA-RCT. Our measure was a pragmatic choice to enable quick assessment of therapy effectiveness during routine follow- up. Also, in our experience, percentage pain relief is a more straightforward concept to convey and understand in the real-world setting compared with VNRS or VAS. In cases where back and leg pain were reported equal, back pain may have been slightly predominant, but not identiﬁed by our verbal questions. Conclusions The present study was designed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of HF-SCS at 10 kHz in a large group of patients with chronic trunk and/or limb pain. Our retro- spective analysis revealed that the therapy provided sus- tained and effective pain relief in >70% of the patients at all follow-up time points. This result was consistent with a previously published randomized, controlled, trial. The majority of our patients also reported improved quality of life, function, and sleep, as well as satisfaction with therapy. Our review provides complementary evidence to support the treatment of chronic back and leg pain with HF-SCS at 10 kHz.

Here, we show  that DBS evokes a large-amplitude resonant neural response focally in the subthalamic nucleus.  This response is greatest in the dorsal region (the clinically optimal stimulation target for  Parkinson disease), coincides with improved clinical performance, is chronically recordable, and is  present under general anesthesia. These features make it a readily utilizable electrophysiological  signal that could potentially be used for guiding electrode implantation surgery and tailoring DBS  therapy to improve patient outcomes. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy that involves surgically implanting  electrodes within specific brain structures and delivering electrical pulses to alleviate  symptoms.1–3 First approved for essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson disease (PD), its  This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which  permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no  modifications or adaptations are made.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts application has expanded to a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders,  including dystonia, epilepsy, pain, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and  addiction.1–4 DBS can be remarkably effective at improving quality of life5; however, a number of  clinical challenges can diminish patient outcomes. In particular, positioning errors in  implanting the millimeter-sized brain targets can lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy,  increased detrimental side effects, and inferior long-term outcomes.6 A robust  electrophysiological biomarker recordable from the DBS electrode itself, and focal to the  neural target, could improve the accuracy of the surgical procedure and also identify the  ideal direction to ""steer"" stimulation for new generation electrodes.7 Previous research has particularly focused on low-frequency (<100Hz) spontaneous local  field potential activity.8,9 In contrast, we investigated whether neural activity evoked by  DBS pulses could yield an alternative and more robust biomarker. Recordings were obtained  from DBS electrodes implanted in several clinical targets including the subthalamic nucleus  (STN) of PD patients and the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) and ventral intermediate  nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) of ET patients. A large-amplitude resonant neural response  was identified that is localizable to the STN and has the potential to facilitate substantial  improvement of DBS therapy. Patients and Methods Patients Subjects were patients undergoing awake DBS implantation surgery. Following ethics  approval, 14 PD and 5 ET patients were recruited (Table) in Melbourne, Australia, at St  Vincent’s (HREC-D 071/14), St Vincent’s Private (R0236-15), and Austin (SSA/15/Austin/ 266) hospitals. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was  registered at www.anzctr.org.au (trial # ACTRN12615001368527). Surgery Following the surgical team’s standard clinical practice, electrode arrays (model 3387;  Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) were implanted bilaterally using trajectories intended to position  electrodes within multiple structures (PD: STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata; ET: PSA  and VIM; Fig 1A, B). Targeting was performed using a stereotactic frame (CRW; Integra  Lifesciences Corporation, Plainsboro, NJ) and preoperative 3-dimensional volumetric  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fused to a contrast-enhanced stereotactic computed  tomography (CT) scan. Microelectrode recordings and therapeutic window assessments  were performed to validate trajectories. Before connection to a subclavicular pulse generator  (Activa, Medtronic) and with the patient still awake, the implanted electrode arrays were  connected to both a biosignal amplifier (g.USBamp; g.tec Medical Engineering,  Schiedlberg, Austria) and a highly controllable external neurostimulator10 to conduct  experiments. Sinclair et al. Page 2 Ann Neurol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 June 29.  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Experimental Stimulation Stimulation comprised monopolar symmetric biphasic pulses (3.38mA, 130Hz, 60- microsecond phase, negative first), as used in other DBS evoked response studies,11,12  temporally patterned into bursts of 10 consecutive pulses every second (see Fig 1C).  Stimulation was sequentially applied to the electrodes specified in the Table for at least 10  seconds each. Signal Processing Neural activity was recorded (fs = 38.4kHz) monopolarly from the same electrode arrays  used for stimulation. Recordings were postprocessed using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick,  MA) by re-referencing to an average of the 4 electrodes implanted in the other hemisphere,  zero-phase forward-reverse filtering (2nd-order Butterworth high-pass [fc = 2Hz] and band- stop [fc = 50Hz] filters), and applying a 21-point moving average. After detrending to  remove baseline offsets, evoked response amplitude was characterized as root mean square  amplitude over 4 to 20 milliseconds after the last pulse of each stimulus burst and  normalized to the sum of response amplitudes across each hemisphere to account for  amplitude disparities across patients, likely due to mediolateral and anteroposterior  positional variation, underlying physiology, and penetration-related stun effects. Due to  stimulation artifacts, very short latency (<1 milliseconds) evoked activity was not  investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma-Plot (Systat Software, San  Jose, CA). Electrode Localization As STN architecture cannot be accurately discriminated using standard 3T MRI, and  inherent variation in STN size, shape, and orientation precludes atlas-based localization, a  reference system was used relative to the readily identifiable red nucleus. Preoperative MRI  and postoperative CT scans (Fig 2A) were coregistered (BRAINSFit, 3D Slicer13) and  electrode coordinates were visually marked by their artifacts and processed in MATLAB.  Research suggests the ideal STN dorsal–ventral location to apply DBS for PD is around  2mm inferior to the superior border of the red nucleus.14 Therefore, electrodes within the  region 1mm above to 2mm below the ideal coordinate were classified as dorsal STN and  electrodes 2 to 5mm below as ventral STN. Electrodes beyond these regions were classified  as superior or inferior to the STN. Postoperative Clinical Assessments Ten PD patients (see Table) were assessed at least 3 months postsurgery (range = 103–586  days, mean = 390 days). Motor performance was assessed by a blinded clinician using the  Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (part III items 20–26). All patients were assessed  off-medication after overnight withdrawal, and chronic stimulation was ceased 45 minutes  prior to baseline ""off-therapy"" assessments. Using the implanted pulse generator, standard  DBS was then bilaterally applied to each of the 4 electrode positions in counterbalanced  order for 30 minutes, with assessments repeated after 15 minutes. Monopolar stimulation  was applied using each patient’s chronic amplitude setting (or 10% less if chronic  Sinclair et al. Page 3 Ann Neurol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 June 29.  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts stimulation was bipolar), or 75% or 50% of that level if not tolerated, with the chronically  used pulse width and stimulation rate. General Anesthesia Recording Due to an infection requiring electrode extension cable replacement, 1 patient (PD09) was  able to be retested 560 days postimplantation. General anesthesia was induced using  propofol and maintained using remifentanil and isoflurane. The chronically implanted  electrode leads were temporarily externalized and burst stimulation was applied to each  electrode as described above. Results DBS in the vicinity of the STN (STN-DBS) was found to evoke a large-amplitude response  with a peak typically ~4 milliseconds after each pulse, which tended to increase in amplitude  and sharpen across the consecutive pulses of a burst (see Fig 1C). This peak was found to be  the first in a series with progressively decreasing amplitude, resembling a decaying  oscillation, so we describe it as evoked resonant neural activity (ERNA). ERNA of similar morphology was observed in every STN of the PD patients, but not in the  PSA of ET patients (see Fig 1D, E). Extremely low amplitude ERNA was observed in 5 of 8  VIMs (see Fig 1E); however, postoperative imaging revealed those electrodes to be located  at the STN border. ERNA amplitude and morphology varied with electrode position relative to the STN (see  Fig 2B), with the largest responses and most apparent decaying oscillation morphology  typically occurring within the STN. Electrodes classified as being within dorsal STN had  significantly higher amplitude ERNA than all other regions (Kruskal–Wallis, H3 = 24.08, p  < 0.001; Dunn post hoc test; see Fig 2C). Postoperative clinical assessments were normalized to off-therapy scores and sorted by  ranking the ERNA amplitude measured at each electrode within each hemisphere (see Fig  2D). Therapeutic benefit was significantly higher at electrodes with higher ERNA  amplitudes (1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, F3, 78 = 14.302, p < 0.001,  Holm–Sidak post hoc test). Despite chronic electrode implantation and the presence of general anesthesia, ERNA was  observed in patient PD09 with comparable amplitude and positional variation to those  recorded at implantation (see Fig 2E, F). Discussion These results establish that STN-DBS evokes resonant neural activity, a robust and clinically  relevant electrophysiological response that is focal to the dorsal subregion where STN-DBS  usually produces the greatest benefit for PD.15 ERNA was observed in all 27 PD STNs  tested, indicating it is a prominent signal measurable across the patient population, and was  absent in all 10 ET PSAs, implying it is a physiological response and not artifactual.  Furthermore, as VIM has previously been reported not to elicit evoked activity beyond ~2  Sinclair et al. Page 4 Ann Neurol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 June 29.  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts milliseconds,11 the extremely low amplitude ERNA observed in some ET patients is likely  due to excitation in the vicinity of the STN by electrodes in proximity, suggesting ERNA is  not specific to PD. Universal presence, along with the STN’s roles in motor, limbic, and  associative function,16 may make ERNA a neuronal response relevant to a number of  clinical indications in addition to PD, although PD remains the predominant indication for  DBS worldwide.4 The presence of a peak evoked by STN-DBS has been reported previously in 2 PD  patients12; however, the full extent and resonant morphology of ERNA is only revealed over  a time window longer than that between DBS pulses delivered at a typical rate, as provided  by our burst stimulation protocol. The exact mechanism underlying the resonant nature is yet  to be established, and it may not necessarily arise from direct activation of the STN itself.  The STN is part of the highly interconnected corticobasal ganglia–thalamocortical network  that forms multiple feedback loops, providing the components of potentially multiple  resonant neural circuits.1,16,17 As such, ERNA may arise from resonant interactions  between the STN and other interconnected structures,1,17 such as the globus pallidus18,19  or the cortex, where resonant responses evoked by STN-DBS have previously been  observed.20,21 Alternatively, ERNA may arise from periods of inhibition and excitation  within the STN itself following each DBS pulse.22 ERNA’s high amplitude, orders of magnitude larger than comparable local field potential  signals, and the improved clinical outcomes when stimulating on electrodes exhibiting  greater ERNA amplitudes suggest it may have applications as a readily recordable feedback  signal for improving DBS therapy; however, further studies are required to determine its  specificity and sensitivity as a possible biomarker. ERNA could potentially be used for  guiding electrode implantation surgery to the most beneficial sites for stimulation in both  awake and anesthetized patients, and for selecting chronic electrode configurations that steer  stimulation to the target structure. Although amplitude variation was the most apparent  feature, other ERNA properties such as peak frequency, latency, or phase reversal may  further prove informative in discriminating STN regions. The sharpening of the first ERNA  peak across the individual pulses of each burst also suggests that resonant state is modulated  by DBS and therefore ERNA may also have utility as a chronically recordable feedback  signal for identifying optimal stimulation parameters, controlling closed-loop therapy, and  providing deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying DBS.

Effec- tive, durable treatments have historically been elusive. Interventional therapies, such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have  shown limited efficacy at best. Recently, a novel treatment, 10 kHz SCS, has demonstrated superior pain relief compared  with traditional SCS in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In this manuscript, we report on the long-term improvements  in quality of life (QoL) outcomes for subjects enrolled in this study. Methods A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (SENZA-RCT) was conducted. Patients with both chronic  back and leg pain were enrolled and randomized (1:1) into 10 kHz SCS or traditional SCS treatment groups. A total of 171  subjects received a permanent SCS device implant. QoL and functionality measures were collected up to 12 months. The  device remote control utilization, which is an indication of patient interaction with the device for adjustments, was collected  at 24-month post-implantation. Results At 12 months, a higher proportion of 10 kHz SCS subjects had marked improvement of their disability (Oswestry  Disability Index) to a “moderate” or “minimal” impact on their daily function versus the control group. The subjects also  reported better improvement in the Global Assessment of Functioning, Clinician Global Impression of Change, Pittsburgh  Sleep Quality Index, and short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire, compared to traditional SCS subjects. The 10 kHz SCS  subjects also reported far higher rates of both driving and sleeping with their device turned on, as well as reduced reliance  on their programmers to adjust therapy settings. Conclusions In addition to superior pain relief, 10 kHz SCS provides long-term improvements in quality of life and func- tionality for subjects with chronic low-back and leg pain.

Chronic, intractable back pain  dramatically affects one’s work function, activities of  daily living, as well as social relationships with friends  and family members. In addition, the global pervasive- ness and intractable nature of this ailment, as the leading  cause of disability in the population, results in tremendous  healthcare utilization [3–5] and loss of workforce produc- tivity [6, 7]. Treatments for chronic pain currently include  exercise, physical therapy, psychological support, phar- maceuticals, interventional procedures, neuromodulation,  and surgery. However, the evidence of efficacy of such  treatments is limited for many chronic pain patients [8].  Thus, there is great need for improved treatment options  for patients living with chronic low-back and leg pain, in  order to not only reduce their pain, but to also improve  their quality of life (QoL). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a well-established  treatment option for chronic neuropathic pain arising  from various etiologies [9–12]. Traditional SCS utilizes  an array of electrodes placed in the epidural space to  deliver low-frequency (∼50 Hz) electrical stimulation to  the dorsal column nerve fibers. This therapy depends on  the induction of paresthesias (tingling or buzzing sen- sations) overlapping the patient’s pain distribution [13].  Paresthesias are caused by the activation of large diameter  Aβ fibers [14]. While it has been found to be an effective  treatment for chronic, intractable neuropathic pain [15,  16], published evidence demonstrates that pain relief from  traditional SCS may not be sustained over the long-term.  Moreover, traditional SCS may not effectively treat axial  low-back pain [15, 17–19]. The arrangement of dorsal  column fibers innervating the axial back makes it diffi- cult to elicit paresthesias in this region using traditional  SCS. Moreover, the intensity of these paresthesias can  also vary, based on body position resulting in either a  sudden, uncomfortable increase in stimulation or persis- tent unwanted sensations [20, 21]. This precludes the use  of traditional SCS during sleeping, driving, and operat- ing machinery. Thus, there remains great potential for  improved efficacy of neuromodulation as an attractive  alternative to both conventional medical management and  more invasive surgical procedures. Recently, a neuromodulation therapy utilizing a high- frequency, 10 kHz stimulation waveform (HF10 therapy)  has emerged as a promising therapeutic option. This  therapy involves percutaneous leads placed in the epi- dural space, similar to traditional SCS. But a combina- tion of anatomical midline lead placement and stimulation  parameters results in paresthesia-free pain relief with  10 kHz SCS. In a multicenter, randomized controlled  trial (SENZA-RCT), 10 kHz SCS demonstrated superior,  long-lasting back and leg pain relief, when compared to  traditional, low-frequency SCS without the need for pain- paresthesia overlap [22, 23]. At 12 months, the responder  rates (≥ 50% pain relief) for the 10 kHz SCS and low- frequency SCS were 76.5% and 49.3% for back pain and  72.9% and 49.3% for leg pain, respectively. Pain relief  is the primary goal when treating subjects with chronic  pain; however, there are secondary measures that reflect  the subjects’ overall well-being and functionality. Out- comes related to QoL, as assessed by appropriate meas- ures of functionality, sleep, pain interference, and subject  satisfaction, elucidate a more comprehensive picture of the  subjects’ disposition [10, 15, 24–28]. We present data col- lected during the SENZA-RCT, demonstrating improved  functionality and QoL outcomes for subjects treated with  10 kHz SCS therapy. Methods This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT01609972) on May 30th, 2012 and conducted in com- pliance with the United States Code of Federal Regulations  and in accordance with recommendations of the 18th World  Medical Assembly (Helsinki, Finland) guiding physicians in  biomedical research. Both the study protocol and informed  consent were approved by each participating site’s govern- ing institutional review board (Western Institutional Review  Board, Puyallup, Washington; Forsyth Medical Center Insti- tutional Review Board, Winston-Salem, North Carolina). All  subjects enrolled in the study provided written, informed  consent prior to their participation. A total of 198 subjects with both back and leg pain were  randomized 1:1 to either low-frequency, traditional SCS or  10 kHz SCS across ten comprehensive pain treatment cent- ers in the United States. Detailed methods, including sub- ject demographics and subject flow diagram, are described  elsewhere [29]. Briefly, a pair of percutaneous leads was  placed in the dorsal epidural space along the radiographic  midline of the spinal column and stimulation was trialed  for up to 14 days. Of the subjects randomized, 189 com- pleted the trial phase and 171 of those had a successful  trial, defined as ≥ 40% reduction in back pain as measured  by the 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). The subjects with  successful trials were implanted with a permanent SCS  system, 90 with 10 kHz SCS (Senza System; Nevro Corp.,  USA) and 81 with traditional SCS (Precision Plus System;  Boston Scientific, USA). Of the 198 subjects (101–10 kHz,  97—low-frequency SCS) randomized to trial stimulation,  2037 Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035–2044  1 3 a total of 9 were not trialed (4–10 kHz SCS and 5—low- frequency SCS) for the following reasons: 10 kHz SCS— medical contraindication (2), withdrawal of consent (1),  lost to follow-up (1); low-frequency SCS—withdrawal of  consent (4), medical contraindication (1). Only those with  a successful trial (≥ 40% pain relief) proceeded to perma- nent implant (10 kHz SCS—90 or 92.8%; low-frequency  SCS—81 or 88.0%). Under the guidance of the study investigators, SCS  devices were programmed by representatives of the respec- tive company according to their best practices. Low-back and  leg pain scores (VAS) were collected at all follow-up visits,  in addition to measures of functionality [Oswestry Disability  Index (ODI) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)],  pain interference [Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire  (SF-MPQ-2)], and sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality  Index (PSQI)]. Overall well-being [Short Form Health Sur- vey (SF-12) and Global Impression of Change (GIC)] data  were also captured at baseline and 12-month post-permanent  device implant. ODI assesses the level of disability as “minimal,” “mod- erate,” “severe,” “crippled,” or “bed bound,” [30] while GAF  categorizes symptoms that affect social, occupational, and  school activities as “none,” “minimal,” “transient,” “mild,”  “moderate,” or “serious” [31]. SF-MPQ-2 measures both  neuropathic and non-neuropathic (affective) pain associated  with a disease condition [32]. GIC assesses the change in  severity of a subject’s pain over time and involves both a  patient’s report as well as a clinician’s evaluation [33, 34].  PSQI assesses seven subscales related to sleep that together  add up to a global score [35]. ODI has been validated in a low-back pain population  [30, 36], whereas SF-MPQ-2 was validated for use in clini- cal research with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain con- ditions [32]. SF-12 is an established, generic measure of  health status used in various disease conditions [37]. All of  the above listed questionnaires along with GIC were recom- mended health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in  chronic pain trials by the Initiative on Methods, Measure- ment and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT)  [38]. Current traditional SCS therapies can cause sudden  changes in paresthesias with activities as the position of the  stimulating electrode and spinal cord varies [39]. Frequent  interaction with the device, by changing the stimulation  or turning the therapy off to avoid unwanted shocks, may  be perceived as burdensome to patient’s normal daily rou- tine. To explore this question, subjects returning for their  24-month follow-up visit were asked how often they used  their remote programmers and whether they carried it with  them when they left the house. Also, the continuous usage  of stimulation including while sleeping and during activi- ties without having to frequently change stimulation settings  could be surrogate marker for good pain relief and quality  of life. Data are presented as the median and 95% confidence  interval (CI) of the median. In outcomes where no base- line values are available for comparison, data are presented  as median and their interquartile range (IQR). Categorical  variables were compared using either Fisher’s exact test or  Mann–Whitney test if there was evidence of non-normality  in the data. This study was powered for the primary end- point of responder rate with a hierarchical testing proce- dure performed for secondary endpoints (all of which were  determined to be significant) [29]. The quality of life out- comes reported in the current manuscript were tertiary or  observational outcomes, and therefore were not subject to  hierarchical testing. As such, we report nominal p values  without correction. Results Oswestry Low‑Back Pain Disability Questionnaire  (ODI) There was no difference between the two groups in baseline  ODI scores, whether analyzing average raw scores (dif- ference in medians: 2.00 [95% CI 0.00–5.33], p = .141,  exact non-parametric Mann–Whitney test, 2-sided) or dis- tribution of subjects among the subcategories (p = .228,  exact non-parametric Mann–Whitney test, 2-sided). At  12 months, however, there was a notable improvement for  the 10 kHz SCS group compared with traditional SCS sub- jects in both average raw scores (difference in medians:  6.00 [95% CI 1.56–11.12], p = .016, exact non-parametric  Mann–Whitney test, 2-sided) and distribution of subjects  among the subcategories (p = .010, exact non-parametric  Mann–Whitney test, 2-sided) (Fig. 1). Within the 10 kHz  SCS group, 69.6% of subjects had an improved ODI score  sufficient to reclassify them into a lower disability cate- gory, whereas 55.1% of traditional SCS subjects were in  a lower disability grouping at 12 months (Table 1). The  specific distribution of subjects among subcategories has  been previously reported [29]. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Baseline scores were 65.00 (IQR 15.00) and 65.00 (IQR  18.25) for 10 kHz SCS and traditional SCS groups, respec- tively (difference in median: 0.00 [95% CI − 2.00–5.00],  p = .511). Improvement in GAF scores at 12 months com- pared to baseline was 14.00 (IQR 15.00) in the 10 kHz SCS  group and 6.50 (IQR 19.00) in the traditional SCS group.  Therefore, improvement in GAF scores for 10 kHz SCS  2038   Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035–2044 1 3 group was higher than that reported in the traditional SCS  group (difference in medians: 5.00, [95% CI 0.10–10.00],  p < .01, Mann–Whitney test). The specific distribution of  subjects among subcategories has been previously reported  [29]. Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF‑MPQ‑2) Compared to their respective baseline values, both tradi- tional SCS and 10 kHz SCS subjects reported reductions  in all components of pain and affective disorder subscales  on the SF-MPQ-2. Comparisons between the two treatment  groups at 12 months revealed that 10 kHz SCS subjects  reported greater improvements than their traditional SCS  counterparts in continuous (difference in medians: 1.17,  [95% CI 2.00–0.50], p < .005), intermittent (difference  in medians: 1.33, [95% CI 2.00–0.50], p < .005), and  neuropathic pain (difference in medians: 0.83, [95% CI  1.50–0.17], p < .01, Mann–Whitney non-parametric test).  However, there was no difference between the treatment  groups on the affective disorders subscale (Fig. 2, dif- ference in medians: 0.25, [95% CI 0.00–0.75], p = .080,  Mann–Whitney non-parametric test).

Both  the traditional and 10 kHz SCS groups showed improve- ment from baseline in their PCS and MCS (Fig. 3). In PCS,  the differences in medians for 10 kHz SCS and traditional  SCS were 7.97 [95% CI 5.72–10.39] and 6.20 [95% CI  3.70–8.78], respectively. In MCS, the differences in medi- ans for 10 kHz SCS and traditional SCS were 3.77 [95%  CI 0.13–7.53] and 2.10 [95% CI 1.26–5.55], respectively.  There was no statistical difference between the groups in  either score. Global Impression of Change (GIC) On the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) question- naire collected at 12 months, 42.0% of traditional SCS subjects  reported feeling “better” or “a great deal better,” compared  to 57.3% of 10 kHz SCS subjects (Fig. 4A, p = .052, Fisher’s  exact test, 2-sided). On the Clinician Global Impression of  Change (CGIC) questionnaire collected at 12 months, 56.5%  of traditional SCS subjects were rated by their physician as  “better” or “a great deal better,” compared to 75.0% of 10 kHz  SCS subjects (Fig. 4B, p = .009, Fisher’s exact test, 2-sided). Sleeping or driving with stimulation on At 12 months, 82 of 86, or 95.3%, of the 10 kHz SCS sub- jects reported leaving the stimulator on while sleeping,  whereas 41 of 69, or 59.4%, of the traditional SCS subjects  did the same (Table 2, p < .001, Fisher’s exact test, 2-sided).  Seventy six of 81, or 93.8%, of the 10 kHz SCS subjects  also reported that they drive with the stimulator turned on,  compared to 40 of 61, or 65.6%, of traditional SCS subjects  who reported doing the same (Table 2, p < .001, Fisher’s  exact test, 2-sided). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI) The PSQI collects data from seven 4-point subscales that  collectively make up the global score. On 6 of the 7 sub- scales, a higher proportion of 10 kHz SCS subjects improved  compared with traditional SCS subjects. The improvement  with 10 kHz SCS subjects was noted to be in subjective  sleep quality, improved sleep latency and duration, better  habitual sleep efficiency, reduced use of sleep medications,  and less daytime dysfunction. A PSQI global score of 5 or  greater indicates poor sleep quality. There was no difference  between the two groups in proportion of “good sleepers”  to “poor sleepers” at baseline (p = .587, Fisher’s exact test,  2-sided). At 12 months, there was no increase in the number  of traditional SCS subjects with good sleep quality but there  was an observable increase in the number of “good sleepers”  among the 10 kHz SCS group compared to traditional SCS  subjects (p = .001, Fisher’s exact test, 2-sided). Reliance on Patient Remote Programmer At 24 months, subjects were asked to complete an optional  survey about their use and reliance on their programmer,  including if they took it outside of their homes and if they  used it daily (n = 55 for 10 kHz SCS and n = 40 for tradi- tional SCS). Approximately 85% of the subjects treated  with traditional SCS, reported carrying their programmer  outside of their homes and 35.4% used their programmers  daily. Only 38.2% of 10 kHz SCS subjects carried the device  with them when they left the house. None of the 10 kHz SCS  subjects used their remote programming device daily. Discussion When evaluating treatments for chronic, intractable pain,  the paramount focus should be on the magnitude of reduc- tion in pain scores. However, improvement in quality of life  Fig. 2  Average scores at baseline and 12 months assessed by the SF- MPQ-2. Data are presented as median and interquartile range with  upper and lower bounds for the subscales of continuous pain (A), neu- ropathic pain (B), intermittent pain (C), and affective descriptors (D) 2040   Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035–2044 1 3 metrics may not be neglected, as they add a comprehensive  overview at patient’s overall function and well-being. The  SENZA-RCT not only demonstrated superior pain relief for  10 kHz SCS subjects with chronic low-back and leg pain  compared to subjects treated with traditional SCS [29], but it  also demonstrated greater improvements across a variety of  QoL measures, including the ODI, GAF, SF-MPQ-2, GIC,  PSQI, and subject remote programmer usage. One assay, the SF-12, showed improvements from  baseline, but did not statistically differ between the two  treatment groups. This instrument is designed to meas- ure QoL and functionality in a wide variety of patient  populations and may lack the sensitivity to detect a differ- ence between the SENZA-RCT treatment groups [40]. In  addition, the SENZA-RCT was powered for the primary  endpoint of responder rates and not the secondary, QoL  endpoints. Thus, a larger sample size may be necessary to  detect differences on the SF-12 questionnaire. Similarly,  this study was not powered to detect differences in sleep  quality as measured by the PSQI, although we do see a  notable increase in the number of 10 kHz SCS subjects at  12 months who score in the “good sleeper” category on the  global scale, while there was no change for traditional SCS  subjects. A larger sample size may help elucidate which  Fig. 3  Subject well-being  as captured at baseline and  the 12-month follow-up with  the SF-12 questionnaire and  reported as two separate sub- scale scores: a physical health  composite score (PCS) and a  mental health composite score  (MCS) 2041 Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035–2044  1 3 specific aspects of sleep quality improve for 10 kHz SCS  subjects. It is noteworthy that this scale has been shown  to correlate strongly with measures of depression, anxiety,  stress, and a negative outlook [41, 42]. Traditional SCS subjects reported much higher daily  usage of their programmers and were more likely to carry  it with them than subjects being treated with 10 kHz SCS.  This suggests that those being treated with 10 kHz were  less burdened by the needs of the therapy. It is possible that  the uncomfortable paresthesia reported in the traditional  SCS group could have attributed to this behavior. Majority  (95.5%) of subjects receiving traditional SCS experienced  paresthesia and of those, 11.1% found it uncomfortable and  39.7% experienced discomfort with changes in posture. The  uncomfortable paresthesia elicited by traditional SCS could  also explain the difference in device usage (10 kHz SCS:  24 ± 0.1 h/day versus traditional SCS: 17.0 ± 7.3 h/day). Another concept which may help interpret clinical out- comes and simplify treatment algorithms would be to estab- lish what constitutes a minimal clinically important differ- ence (MCID) for a variety of measures commonly used in  chronic pain research. MCID is defined as “The smallest dif- ference in score in the domain of interest which patients per- ceive as beneficial and which would mandate, in the absence  of troublesome side effects and excessive cost, a change  in the patient’s management” [43]. Few studies assessing  SCS therapy have examined MCID in functional and QoL  outcomes. Defining MCID threshold for QoL assessments  would help identify what level of score improvement an  intervention is of noticeable benefit to the patient; therefore,  potentially worth the attendant risks. For the ODI, several  studies have defined a range of absolute value changes in  the overall score as an MCID [44–48]. An analysis of the  SENZA-RCT ODI data per the MCID definitions estab- lished in these studies demonstrate the responder rates for  both traditional SCS and 10 kHz SCS subjects at 12 months  which is depicted in Fig. 5. Regardless of how conservative  the definition of the MCID is, approximately 10–15% more  10 kHz SCS subjects achieved an MCID than their tradi- tional SCS counterparts. Presenting the data in this manner,  as the proportion of subjects who report a MCID from their  baseline score, will provide a standard by which a physician  can evaluate the clinical significance of an improved score.  Further research to establish MCID thresholds for additional  QoL assessments would be of tremendous value. Fig. 4  The percentage of subjects categorized into “a great deal bet- ter,” “better,” “moderately better,” “somewhat better,” “a little bet- ter,” “almost the same,” or “no change” by the GIC administered at  12 months. This assessment is completed by both the patient (PGIC,  A) and the clinician (CGIC, B). The total percentage of subjects  whose change from baseline was classified as either “a great deal bet- ter” or “better” is indicated next to each bar Table 2  Subject device usage while sleeping or driving Results of subject questionnaire at 12 months about SCS use during  sleep and while driving.

Results presented here  further demonstrate that 10 kHz SCS markedly improves  secondary outcomes that reflect the subjects’ better health,  functionality, and overall well-being. The higher subject  satisfaction scores could be due to the absence of paresthe- sias with 10 kHz SCS and/or the superior, stable pain relief.  Based on the available data, it is reasonable to postulate that  a high degree of pain relief, in the absence of paresthesias,  enables the subjects to carry out daily activities, including  driving and sleeping, without experiencing unwanted stim- ulation from postural changes, a common complaint with  traditional low-frequency SCS systems [50, 51]. A limitation of the study was that these tertiary endpoints  were not powered to assess multiple hypothesis tests. Other  study limitations include the subjects and the investigators  not being masked to the assigned treatment group and the  heterogeneity of pain diagnoses, as previously discussed  [23]. The SENZA-RCT not only demonstrated sustainably  improved pain scores with 10 kHz SCS, but it also improved  measures related to quality of life in a clinically meaning- ful manner, superior to traditional SCS for this given pain  patient population.

Forty seven per cent derived significant benefit, 23% modest benefit, 20% experienced no effect and 6-7% were made worse. Two were made worse after initial benefit. Complications, indications and factors relevant to the mode of action are discussed. The analgesic effect of electrical stimulation has been known since Roman times, when the shock from an electric fish was used to relieve gout pain.'2 The gate theory of pain' inspired Shealy to implant the first dorsal column stimulator in a human in 1967,4 the dorsal columns being rich in the large, low-threshold A-fl fibres, which were alleged to ""close the gate"" against nociception-subserving afferents. Several thousand electrical spinal cord stimulators have since been implanted but the procedure remains controversial owing to a lack of agreement regarding its indications, lack of consistency in reported efficacy and lack of understanding of its mechanism of action. Department of Neurosurgery, The London Hospital, Whitechapel, London, UK B A Simpson Correspondence to: Mr Simpson, Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Wales, Heath Park, Cardiff CF4 4XW, UK Received 20 November 1989 and in revised form 2 March 1990. Accepted 21 August 1990 Materials and methods Of the first 62 consecutive cases with spinal cord stimulators inserted by the Department of Neurosurgery at The London Hospital, 60 were examined retrospectively. Data from two cases could not be retrieved and these were excluded from the report. The 60 cases com- prised 34 males, age range 28-74 (median 55) years, duration of symptoms one to 37 (median seven) years and 26 female, ages 21- 74 (57) years and duration of symptoms three months to 50 (eight) years. Follow up was from two weeks to nine years (median 29 months); 19 were followed for more than five years. All electrodes were inserted via lamin- ectomy and in most cases secured to the dura with silk sutures. There were five unipolar electrodes, 11 bipolar of percutaneous type (but not implanted percutaneously), 32 bipolar plate, 11 4-pole plate electrodes and one unrecorded. Of 24 who were tested via temporary exter- nal leads only four failed to proceed to full implantation. Those four cases are included in the analysis. No temporary external leads were employed after January 1983 and im- plantation at a single operation was first per- formed in April 1979. Overall, four of the 56 ""permanently"" implanted had an intracor- poreal pulse generator and 52 had radio- frequency (RF) coupled devices with an exter- nal transmitter. Electrode positions were: high cervical 18 cases, mid cervical three, low cervical four, high thoracic 18, mid thoracic 15 and low thoracic two cases. In cases with facial pain the electrodes were placed over the spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract. The systems were inserted for a variety of pain states unresponsive to all other measures tried. From July 1982, 48 of the 56 perma- nently implanted patients (86%) were foll- owed up in a dedicated neurostimulation clinic held weekly. Detailed records were kept of wave forms and fields recorded via surface electrodes. Faults in internal and external apparatus were diagnosed and located and appropriate remedial measures taken.5 Outcome was assessed according to four categories: 1) Made worse (MW): self-explanatory. 2) No effect (NE): on symptoms in the presence of a functioning stimulator. 3) Modest benefit (MB): definite im- provement gained, but without sub- stantial benefit, for example short-lived relief, no significant change in medica- tion, activity, sleep pattern etc. 4) Significant benefit (SB): complete relief or partial, but sustained relief with a significant effect on medication, activity, life-style, sleep pattern. Con- sistent praise of the apparatus by the patient, being awoken in pain when accidently disconnected during sleep, significant deterioration coinciding with apparatus failure. The data are too few to subject them to statistical analysis. Results Four patients (6-7%) were made worse. All were male but there were no other common features. Another two were made worse after initial benefit; one had developed an aversion to the implanted device after several months of MB and the other change occurred after three years and six months of SB in a man with facial anaesthesia dolorosa who developed primary hyperparathyroidism. Twelve patients (20%) reported no effect on their pain; there were no common features. Modest benefit was gained by 14 (23.3%) and significant benefit by 28 (46-7%). Thus 70% derived benefit. Overall, 10 patients experien- ced complete relief of their pain, three had virtually complete relief and three who had 196 Spinal cord stimulation in 60 cases of intractable pain Table I Effiicacy: sex distribution Total MW NE MB SB MB-MW SB MW Male 34 4 3 11 15 - 1 Female 26 - 9 3 13 1 - Table 2 Results related to age atfirst operation Age Total MW NE MB SB MB aMW SB-MW 20-29years 3 - - - 3 - 30-39years 6 - 1 2 3 - 40-49 years 12 1 4 2 5 - 50-59 years 13 1 1 5 5 - 1 60-69 years 19 2 4 3 9 1 - 70+ years 7 - 2 2 3 - - 60 4 12 14 28 1 1 Table 3 Results related to duration of symptoms Duration Total MW NE MB SB MB MW SB aMW < I year 1 - 1 - - - 1-4 years 20 2 5 3 9 1 - 5-9 years 19 - 3 5 10 - 1 10-14 years 7 - 2 4 1 - - 15-19 years 4 2 - 1 1 - 20-24years 4 - 1 - 3 - 25-30years 1 1 - - - > 30years 5 - - 1 4 - - *61 4 12 *15 28 1 1 *One patient had two pains of different duration Table 4 Results related to presence or absence of appropriate evoked paraesthesiae Total MW NE MB SB MB - MW SB-MW Appropriate paraesthesiae Present 45 3 5 8 27 1 1 Absent 9 - 4 4 1 - - Unknown 6 1 3 2 - - - more than one pain obtained complete relief of one. Of the 20 implanted after a period of testing via external leads, one became MW, two NE, five MB and 12 SB. Women were more likely to feel that there was no effect than were men, but if a woman felt an effect it was more likely to be significant (table 1). The proportion benefiting became smaller with increasing age; eight of the nine cases below 40 years benefited. However, more than half of those over 60 years derived benefit (table 2). One third had had intractable pain for more than 10 years, but long duration did not mitigate against success; seven of the 10 with pain duration of more than 20 years derived significant benefit (table 3). Stimulation via electrodes placed over the dorsal columns evokes sensations of tingling, ""bumping"" or warmth. In table 4 ""appro- priate paraesthesiae"" refers to such sensations occurring within the painful area. The four MB and one SB without appropriate paraes- thesiae had evoked sensations, but not in the painful area. It appears that an evoked sensa- tion is necessary for pain relief, but it does not have to be in the painful area although in the majority of cases it was. Evoked paraesthesiae do not, however, guarantee pain relief (table 4). It can be seen from table 5 that the condi- tions most likely to respond are traumatic and unplanned surgical peripheral denervations, idiopathic chronic focal pain, ischaemic pain, painful paraparesis, paraplegia and hemi- paresis, particularly if caused by an acute event, and the ""failed back"" syndrome (chronic low back pain usually with sciatica after several or many surgical procedures). Success may occur, but with less certainty, in the thalamic syndrome, phantom pain, stump pain, anaesthesia dolorosa and some nocicep- tive pains. The single patients each with syringomelia and tabes dorsalis also benefited. Post herpetic neuralgia yielded only one MB from three cases.

Of effective frequencies selected, 81% were within the range 50-120 cycles per second. Only two patients found that only frequencies below this range were effective and only one patient found frequencies up to 1400 cps effec- tive. Of effective pulse widths recorded, 19% were less than 0 5 ms and 67% were 0 5 to 0-8 ms. The commonest effective pulse width employed was 0 5 ms (33%). Eleven of the patients who benefited used their stimulator for 24 hours every day, 14 used it all day and left it off at night and in 17 the pattern was different or unknown. Of six patients who developed tolerance to the anal- gesic effect, five were continuous users. There were no deaths and no neurological deterioration related to surgery or to stimula- tion. The complications most frequently lead- ing to re-operation were electrode failure (through electrode fracture or the inter- position of scar tissue between electrode and dura), electrode movement and connector failure (table 6). Infection occurred in three cases (5%) two of whom had had temporary external leads. Overall, the average total num- ber of operations per patient was 2 8. If opera- tions for infection and for the original implan- tation are excluded, however, then the average number of additional operations after implan- tation per non-responder (MW plus NE) was 0-56 and per responder (MB plus SB) was 1-7. Responders therefore had three times as many additional operations as non-responders. Almost 50% (29 cases) needed no re-opera- tion after initial implantation. Discussion This series covers a wide range of conditions which differs from that in many other series. Mittal, for example, had a higher proportion (more than 60%) of ""failed back"" syndrome6 and in the USA this figure reaches 94%7 compared with 12% in the present series. Others have a greater experience of post amputation (stump and phantom) pain.89 Whilst the ability to evoke paraesthesiae was a necessary condition for pain relief, it was not necessary for the paraesthesiae to be within the painful area (although in most cases it was) and this conflicts with the findings of others.' Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is not a universal analgesic; it is most effective against pain due to partial and abrupt deafferentation, to ischaemia and in some nociceptive pains. Thus painful paraparesis responds better than complete paraplegia, particularly if caused by acute trauma. In one report the best results with SCS in cancer pain occurred in the cases which had neurological deficit. 2 The effective- ness of SCS in ischaemic limb pain has been widely reported""""'6 and is supported here. The results in phantom pain were similar to those of others.8917 The overall result of this series is consistent with other series. An overall success rate of 40-60% has been reported by several authors 8017- although others have reported less success.121 Young reported that an initial 47% relief fell to only 8% after three years,22 whereas Long found that better case selection improved his success rate from 33-70%.23 Differences in patient populations and in methods of assessment make comparisons un- reliable, however. Implantation after a period of trial stimula- tion resulted in 17/20 (85%; four were not permanently implanted) deriving benefit com- pared with 25/36 (69-4%) of those implanted directly. Trial stimulation, however, did not prevent one MW and two NE and the infection rate was higher after a percutaneous trial (10% compared with 2-8%). Trial stimulation therefore appears to increase the rate of sub- sequent success but is not infallible and may increase morbidity. Good results from SCS depend not only upon case selection, but also upon thorough follow up by a team able to recognise and to rectify faults and a willingness on the part of both patient and surgeon to re-operate when necessary. Those benefiting from SCS had three times as many additional operations as non-responders, which supports the assess- ment and suggests that good responders were more willing to undergo re-operation. The results suggest that infected systems should be removed completely as attempts at preservation are unlikely to be successful. Tolerance to SCS can be prevented by avoiding continuous use. Tolerance may have contributed to the loss of response with time reported by others.2224 Assessing the results of treatment of chronic pain is problematical. After months or years of relief or modulation, the quality and intensity of the original pain may not be accurately remembered. Patients' quantifications may be unreliable (for example, ""20% relief, but the pain is-twice as bad when I stop stimulating""). Patients' interpretations may differ from the doctor's: a patient complained that his stimulator did not work because as soon as he switched it off the pain returned. Another reported no pain relief, but was able to discon- tinue her intake ofapproximately 200 analgesic tablets per month. Koeze25 assessed 26 patients who are included in the present series and who were extant and using stimulation in 1986. He found on a quantitative assessment that exactly half obtained 50%/ or more relief, but there were discrepancies between this and the patient's assessment of the ""worth"" of the treatment. However, assessments by three different third parties (clinician, psychologist and relative or close friend) correlated well with each other. Return to work is not regarded as a useful Simpson Spinal cord stimulation in 60 cases of intractable pain marker in the present series whose median age was in the mid fifties and which contained many disabled people. Appropriate stimulation must be occurring before a case is designated as ""failed stimulation""; some cases are in fact failed attempts at achieving appropriate stimulation. The- mechanism of action- of SCS is un- known. Fully blind studies are impossible but an explanation in terms of placebo response is refuted by the success rate and by the longevity of response in addition to the need for the electrodes to be above the neurological level of the pain. A patient may experience evoked paraesthesiae but have no pain relief until the electrodes are re-positioned or the stimulation parameters are altered. Many other treatments will have been tried before SCS including, surgical procedures, drug therapy, physio- therapy, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, relaxa- tion therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) without a placebo response occurring. Finally, SCS can induce analgesia in animals.26 Although elevated sensory thresholds'0227 and reduced somatosensory evoked poten- tials'"" in the presence of SCS in humans have been reported, an overt alteration in sensation is not an accompaniment of effective SCS.2 Furthermore, SCS is no more effective against nociceptive pain than against deafferentation pain. SCS activates several pathways in the spinal cord3' and has been shown to influence thalamic activity in the monkey and the human.2932 . In peripheral vascular disease the analgesic effect of SCS may be, in part, secon- dary to an increase in perfusion.ll6 Any theory must explain the evoked paraes- thesiae felt in phantom limbs, the universal observation that the electrodes must be both ipsilateral and (except in facial pain) neurologically rostral to the painful area, the autonomic effects of SCS and the fact that the pain is converted into a neutral or even a pleasant sensation rather than being simply blocked or ""gated"". SCS is reversible, non-destructive, has a low morbidity and unlike destructive measures does not itself produce deafferentation pain. Controversy persists regarding the method of implantation and the validity of selection by trial stimulation but SCS can be a highly effective therapy in selected chronically suffer- ing patients for whom little or nothing else can be offered.

ACCURATE, a pivotal, prospective, multicenter, randomized comparative effectiveness trial, was conducted in 152 subjects diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia in the lower extremities. Subjects received neurostimulation of the DRG or dorsal column (spinal cord stimulation, SCS). The primary end point was a composite of safety and efficacy at 3 months, and subjects were assessed through 12 months for long-term outcomes and adverse events. The predefined primary composite end point of treatment success was met for subjects with a permanent implant who reported 50% or greater decrease in visual analog scale score from preimplant baseline and who did not report any stimulation-related neurological deficits. No subjects reported stimulation-related neurological deficits. The percentage of subjects receiving $50% pain relief and treatment success was greater in the DRG arm (81.2%) than in the SCS arm (55.7%, P , 0.001) at 3 months. Device-related and serious adverse events were not different between the 2 groups. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation also demonstrated greater improvements in quality of life and psychological disposition. Finally, subjects using DRG stimulation reported less postural variation in paresthesia (P , 0.001) and reduced extraneous stimulation in nonpainful areas (P 5 0.014), indicating DRG stimulation provided more targeted therapy to painful parts of the lower extremities. As the largest prospective, randomized comparative effectiveness trial to date, the results show that DRG stimulation provided a higher rate of treatment success with less postural variation in paresthesia intensity compared to SCS.

Introduction The prevalence of neuropathic pain refractory to the current standard of care has been estimated to be 1.5% of the general population.26 Spinal cord stimulation (SCS), for which electrodes are placed into the dorsal epidural space, is an available treatment of a variety of chronic neuropathic pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).8 Specific challenges for SCS remain, especially for pain conditions such as CRPS I and causalgia that differ by etiology and symptom profile from other chronic pain syndromes. An estimated 40% to 50% of CRPS subjects achieved clinically meaningful pain relief with SCS.11,14 Similar rates of successful pain relief are reported for heterogeneous populations that contain a significant CRPS population.23 Less than optimal Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article. a Center for Pain Relief, Charleston, WV, USA, b Marcus Neuroscience Institute, Boca Raton, FL, USA, c St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, CA and Plano, TX, USA, d University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA, e IPM Medical Group, Inc, Walnut Creek, CA, USA, f Neurovations, Napa, CA, USA, g Premier Pain Center, Shrewsbury Township, NJ, USA, h Houston Pain Centers, Houston, TX, USA, i HOPE Research—TPC, Phoenix, AZ, USA, j HOPE Research—LVSP, Las Vegas, NV, USA, k Pain Management Associates, Independence, MO, USA, l Florida Pain, Merritt Island, FL, USA, m Carolinas Pain Institute, Winston-Salem, NC, USA, n Newport Beach Headache and Pain, Newport Beach, CA, USA, o Comprehensive Pain and Rehabilitation, Pascagoula, MS, USA, p Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA, q Holy Cross Hospital, Ft.

Lack of precision with SCS is attributed to shunting of energy by the cerebral spinal fluid, positional variations in stimulation, segmentation of spinal sensory input, and lead migrations postimplantation.18 In some cases, these challenges can be addressed with improved surgical techniques and device pro- gramming, but pain related to CRPS and causalgia remains difficult to treat; many SCS patients do not achieve high-level pain relief, despite efforts to improve techniques and programming.14 The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a key role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain.13 The DRG, located between every spinal nerve and the spinal cord on the posterior root, houses the somas of the primary sensory neurons. These somas process and transmit sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Animal models of chronic pain have shown that pathophysiologic changes occur in the DRG, including altered electrophysiological membrane properties, altered expression of integral membrane proteins, and altered expression of various genes that contribute to the hyperexcitability of neurons.15 The combination of the DRG’s sensory function and accessibility through familiar epidural approaches make it an ideal target for neurostimulation. Pain therapies targeting the DRG included radiofrequency frequency ablation, steroid injections, and ganglionectomy.8 Initial evidence with 8 CRPS patients suggested that DRG stimulation may besuccessful in a larger proportion of subjects than SCS (71% vs 50%).28 Thus, the ACCURATE study, a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, evaluated DRG stimulation compared to SCS stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain of the lower limbs attributed to CRPS or causalgia. 2. Methods Under an Investigational Device Exemption, the ACCURATE study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DRG stimulation compared to traditional SCS for subjects with CRPS or causalgia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01923285). The study was conducted in 22 US sites. Prior to any study initiation, all sites obtained approval from the institutional review board, and subjects were enrolled only after informed consent was obtained. 2.1. Patient selection Subjects who had chronic, intractable neuropathic pain of the lower limbs associated with a diagnosis of CRPS or causalgia were screened and determined to be eligible according to the inclusion or exclusion criteria of the study (Table 1). Patients were diagnosed with CRPS type 1 based on the Budapest criteria.12 Causalgia was defined as a painful condition arising from damage to a nerve resulting in chronic pain, generally restricted to the innervation pattern of the damaged nerve or nerves, which may or may not have secondary symptoms.25 The diagnosis, in every case, was confirmed by an experienced medical monitor (N.M.) for strict adherence to these diagnostic criteria. Briefly, eligible subjects were naive to stimulation, had chronic, intractable pain for at least 6 months, tried and failed at least 2 prior pharmacologic treatments from 2 different drug classes, had stable neurologic function 30 days prior to screening, and were free from psychological pathology that contraindicated an implantable device. Subjects with changing or escalating pain condition or unstable use of pain medication 30 days prior to enrollment were not considered eligible to participate in the study. All subjects’ medical, psychological, and imaging records were evaluated by an independent medical monitor to ensure appropriate patient selection. 2.2. Study design After signing informed consent, subjects underwent a baseline evaluation to determine enrollment eligibility. After enrollment, subjects were randomized to either DRG stimulation (DRG group) or traditional SCS (SCS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Random- ization was based on random, permuted blocks and stratified by study center. The study’s centralized electronic data collection system provided the subjects’ randomized group assignments after subjects were enrolled. Subjects, investigators, and study site staff were not blinded to subjects’ assigned therapy. Subjects proceeded to a temporary trial stimulation phase (ranging from 3 to 30 days based on each site’s standard of care), using the device type stipulated by their randomization. The average trial stimulation phase in the DRG group was 5.8 (SD 2.8) days and 5.8 (SD 5.1) days for the SCS group (P 5 0.206, Wilcoxon test). Successful trial stimulation was determined by the subject achieving at least a 50% lower limb pain relief during the trial phase and expressing a desire to go on to a permanent implant. Subjects who were successful during the trial phase were eligible to continue on to permanent implantation. Subjects who failed the trial stimulation phase were exited from the study. However, data from the trial failures were included as treatment failures for the composite treatment success end point at 3 months and at subsequent time points through 12 months. Subjects in both arms, who achieved a successful outcome during the trial phase, were implanted with a permanent device and were followed for 12 months, with follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postimplant. Subjects were not allowed to change the maximum daily dose of their prescribed chronic lower limb pain medications from baseline to the 3-month follow-up visit at which time the primary and secondary end points were ascertained. Postoperative reprogramming to optimize therapy was allowed for both groups at any time during the study, per standard of care for neuro- modulation devices. Programming occurred by respective companies (Medtronic and Spinal Modulation) under the guid- ance of appropriate clinical and technical industry personnel. 2.3. Description of devices and implant procedures Dorsal root ganglion stimulation was delivered by the AXIUM Neurostimulator System (Spinal Modulation; LLC, Menlo Park, CA, a wholly owned subsidiary of St Jude Medical), which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for spinal column stimulation via epidural and intraspinal lead access to the DRG as an aid in the management of moderate to severe chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs in adult patients with CRPS type I and causalgia. The system is composed of percutaneous leads designed to stimulate the DRG, an external trial pulse generator, and an implantable pulse generator. Traditional SCS was delivered with a commercially available system (RestoreUltra and RestoreSensor; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) indicated for a number of chronic pain conditions including CRPS I and causalgia. Both devices were programmed by separate technicians for each arm such that the programming was performed by experienced personnel for the specific device to achieve optimal analgesia. See Table 2 for a summary of programming parameters used during the study for both devices. 670 T.R. Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® Standard procedures for trial and permanent implantations were used in the study. Dorsal root ganglion leads were placed in the lateral epidural space near the target DRG at levels from T10 to S2, depending on the dermatomal target corresponding to the subject’s primary region of pain. Spinal cord stimulation leads were placed in the medial or paramedial epidural space such that the caudal-most electrical contact was not caudal to the top of the L1 vertebral body on an anterior–posterior fluoroscopic view. Depending on the anatomical target, up to 16 contacts were placed for both study arms. Intraoperative testing to determine stimulation overlap with subjects’ painful areas was conducted during implantation. Figure 1 shows the lead placements for both groups. Table 3 summarizes the number and placement of leads for subjects in the study. 2.4. Sample size calculation and analysis populations Sample size was determined based on the planned noninferiority test for the composite safety and effectiveness primary end point of treatment success. Treatment success was defined as $50% reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) score in the primary area of pain during both trial and the 3-month visits with no incidence of stimulation-induced neurological deficits. Pilot data with 8 CRPS subjects and 22 causalgia subjects indicated that the success rate of DRG, defined as a 50% reduction in pain intensity, was 87% for CRPS subjects and 77% for causalgia subjects. Thus, an observed success rate at of least 15% above the 50% rate reported for SCS subjects was expected.14,28 Accounting for 15% attrition, an estimated 152 subjects (76 subjects in each arm) would provide greater than 85% power to test the primary end point hypothesis with a noninferiority margin of 10%. The primary, secondary, and tertiary effectiveness analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population including all randomized subjects who participated in the trial procedure (73 in each group). The MITT population was based on standard intention-to-treat principles, wherein subjects were analyzed based on their initial randomized treatments. The binary composite end points for success included subjects who failed the trial evaluation and exited the study as treatment failures. Table 1 Inclusion or exclusion criteria.

Data collection and general statistical methods Patient demographics and medical history were collected at baseline. At baseline and at each study visit, physical and neurological examinations, along with medication utilization, were recorded by study staff. Pain intensity was measured at baseline and at each study visit using the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain) where higher scores represent greater pain severity. At baseline and each study visit, assessments of quality of life, psychological disposition, and experiential factors (measures described in detail below)werecompleted.Alladverseevents(AEs)through12months were reported and the occurrence of any stimulation-related neurological deficits was documented. Descriptive statistics are presented as number of subjects, mean, SD, median, and range for all continuous variables and the number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables. As stipulated by the protocol and with the exception of the primary end point analysis, DRG stimulation and SCS were compared using a 2-sample t test (or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) for continuous outcomes and Pearson x2 test (or Fisher exact test) for categorical outcomes. Choice of parametric or alternative tests was based on the data distributions for each measure, and the test used is reported in the results. Two-sided confidence intervals are also provided for certain outcome measures of interest to assess differences between the treatment arm and the control arm. 2.6. Primary composite end point The predefined primary composite end point of the study was treatment success rates for the DRG subjects compared to the SCS subjects. To be considered a treatment success (1) a subject had a successful trial reporting $50% reduction in VAS score from baseline to the end of the trial phase, (2) reported a VAS Table 2 Programming settings. 3 mo 6 mo 9 mo 12 mo DRG SCS DRG SCS DRG SCS DRG SCS No. of subjects with available data 59 54 59 52 55 49 55 50 Frequency or rate range, Hz Mean (6SD) 20.8 (7.1) 65.5 (111.2) 20.0 (6.8) 63.6 (54.3) 19.0 (5.5) 72.0 (102.1) 19.0 (5.1) 63.6 (48.7) Min, max 10.0, 48.0 10.0, 1200.0 10.0, 48.0 10.0, 500.0 8.0, 40.0 15.0, 1000.0 10.0, 36.0 2.0, 3600.0 Pulse width, ms Mean (6SD) 306.4 (148.1) 408.2 (191.0) 315.4 (166.0) 432.5 (183.0) 295.6 (140.7) 432.6 (193.9) 289.8 (133.8) 417.1 (172.7) Min, max 30.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 90.0, 1000.0 90.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 90.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 Amplitude, mA Mean (6SD) 915.4 (822.0) 3288.8 (2255.2) 822.3 (724.0) 3590.4 (1912.6) 764.6 (630.9) 3304.1 (1848.8) 827.4 (657.1) 2929.7 (2024.3) Min, max 75.0, 6000.0 0.0, 9533.1 1.0, 4600.0 0.0, 10,076.3 100.0, 3950.0 0.0, 13,380.1 75.0, 4000.0 0.0, 12,659.8 DRG, dorsal root ganglion; SCS, spinal cord stimulation.

Figure 1. Lead placement. The lead for dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation is specialized to provide percutaneous entry through the epidural space, exiting through the foramen, and resting around the DRG. As shown in panel A, DRG leads were placed in the lateral epidural space near the target DRG. For the SCS arm (panel B), leads were placed in the medial or paramedial epidural space such that the caudal-most electrical contact was not caudal to the top of the L1 vertebral body on an anterior–posterior fluoroscopic view. Depending on the anatomical target, up to 16 contacts were placed for both study arms. Intraoperative testing to determine paresthesia overlap over pain areas was conducted during trial evaluation period. 672 T.R. Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® score at 3 months that was reduced from preimplant baseline by $50%, and (3) did not experience a stimulation-related neuro- logical deficit during either the trial phase or after permanent implant. A stimulation neurological deficit, different from AEs, was defined as a measurable 2-point worsening on the in-clinic sensory and motor neurological examination, within the appro- priate concordant anatomy, that was induced by stimulation and subsided in the absence of stimulation for at least 24 hours. Sensory and motor examinations were conducted by the physician and rated as 2 (normal function), 1 (decreased function), or 0 (abnormal function); a score of 0 would indicate neurological deficit. No neurological deficits, as defined, were recorded for any subjects in either arm of the study. In addition, if a subject withdrew from the study due to a device-, procedure-, or stimulation-related AE, the subject was treated as a failure in the primary end point analysis. As prespecified, the primary end point analyzed the success rate between the two treatment arms using Blackwelder methods for testing noninferiority between 2 proportions at a one-sided significance of 0.05.3 The noninferiority margin was set at 10%. If noninferiority of the primary end point was achieved, a superiority test was performed at a one-sided significance level of 0.025. 2.7. Secondary end point 2.7.1. Positional effects on paresthesia intensity Paresthesia intensity, a prespecified secondary end point, was assessed at 3 months. Paresthesia intensity was rated by subjects using a previously published paresthesia intensity rating scale.16 Subjects rated the intensity of their perception of paresthesia, while upright and supine, on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 representing “No feeling” to 10 “Very intense.” Perceived paresthesia intensity difference between supine and upright positions was calculated and averaged across each group This end point was evaluated at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 2.8. Other end points 2.8.1. Short-Form-36 The Short-Form-36 (SF-36) is a self-reported health-related quality-of-life scale with 36 questions that yield scores on 8 dimensions of quality of life including physical functioning, role- physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health.27,29 These 8 dimensions also are combined to provide 2 summary scales for physical health (Physical Component Summary) and mental health (Mental Component Summary). Improvements on the SF-36 scale are represented by increased scores. Within- and between-group improvements were examined using the calculated change from baseline for each subscale or summary scales. 2.8.2. Profile of mood states The profile of mood states (POMS) scale is a 65-item, 5-point Likert scale that measures mood states overall (total mood disturbance) as well as for 6 domains: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. Higher scores indicate more negative mood states except for the vigor domain where higher scores indicate increased vigor.6 Within- and between- group improvements were examined using the calculated change from baseline for each domain and the total POMS score. 2.8.3. Brief pain inventory The brief pain inventory (BPI) measures pain severity in the last 24 hours on a numeric pain rating scale from 0 “No pain” to 10 “Pain as bad as you can imagine,” and interference due to pain from 0 “Does not interfere” to 10 “Completely interferes.”5 The interference score was calculated as the mean of the interference items, and 2 subscales for the activity dimension and the affective dimensions of interference were tabulated. Within- and between- group improvements were examined using the calculated change from baseline for the pain and interference scales and for each interference subscale. 2.8.4. Subject satisfaction Subjects completed a satisfaction scale at the end of trial phase and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Subjects rated satisfaction with pain relief and the therapy in general on an 11-point numeric rating scale with 0 indicating “Not Satisfied” and 10 indicating “Very Satisfied.” Subjects rated the likelihood of undergoing the therapy again on an 11-point numeric rating scale with 0 indicating “Not Likely” and 10 indicating “Very Likely.” Finally subjects rated the their subjective change in pain since baseline on a 7 point scale ranging from “Much Worse” to “Much Better.” Ratings were treated as interval data and summarized with descriptive statistics of central tendency. 2.8.5. Stimulation specificity Stimulation specificity was evaluated to determine the extent to which paresthesia was felt by subjects in anatomical regions that were not painful at baseline. The pain and paresthesia diagram forms had identical diagrams of the human body on which subjects marked where they felt pain and paresthesia. The baseline pain diagrams completed by the subjects were compared to the subjects’ paresthesia maps completed at the end of trial phase and at 3 months postimplant. Subjects were categorized based on the presence or absence of one or more paresthesia areas at follow-up that were not coincident with a pain area at baseline. 2.8.6. Percentage change in visual analog scale The percentage of change in VAS score from baseline to each scheduled follow-up was computed for each subject and inspected using descriptive statistics and confidence intervals. Missing data were not imputed for this analysis; only subjects with VAS scores at baseline and follow-up were included in the analysis. 2.9. Safety analysis Adverse events were collected and tabulated at all scheduled or unscheduled visits during the study. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom or disease temporarily associated with the use of the implanted device, whether or not related to the device. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any AE that is immediately life threatening; results in significant, persistent, or permanent disability; neces- sitates invasive intervention to prevent permanent impairment or death; results in the need for a 24-hour hospital stay or prolongation of a hospital stay; or results in death. Adverse event and SAE rates are expressed as the number of patients divided by the population at risk for each group (n 5 76) through the 12-month study visit. All AEs reported were reviewed by an April 2017·Volume 158·Number 4 www.painjournalonline.com 673 independent event committee that coded and adjudicated each event with regard to seriousness and relatedness to the implant procedure, device, and/or stimulation therapy. 3. Results 3.1. Patient accounting See CONSORT diagram for full accounting (Fig. 2). Briefly, 320 subjects were consented and enrolled in the study from 22 investigational sites. Of these subjects, 168 were excluded for screen failures because they failed to meet the study’s inclusion or exclusion criteria with the majority failing to meet the diagnostic criteria for inclusion. The remaining 152 subjects were enrolled and randomized to either the DRG or the SCS arm (76 in each arm). After randomization, 3 subjects from each group did not continue to the trial evaluation phase. Subjects who failed the success criterion at the end of the trial phase were exited from the study and considered treatment failures for composite end point analyses. A total of 61 DRG subjects and 54 SCS subjects met the success criteria at the end of their trial phase and continued to permanent implant. By the 12-month visit, 55 DRG subjects and 50 SCS subjects had evaluable data. On average, each active study site randomized 3 subjects (range 0, 9) to each arm of the study. At any one site, the maximum number of randomized subjects was 11% (17/152) of the MITT population. 3.2. Baseline characteristics The average age of subjects was 52.4 years in the DRG stimulation arm and 52.5 years in the SCS arm. There were slightly more females than males in both arms (51.3% for both arms). Race was predominantly white (94.7% and 92.1% for DRG and SCS, respectively). Average body mass index was 30.5 for DRG and 28.9 for SCS. The average duration of chronic lower limb pain was 7.5 years for the DRG arm and 6.8 years for the SCS arm. Comorbidities and medications taken for subject conditions were similar in both arms. Overall, no statistically significant differences were found among the baseline characteristics between treatment arms.SeeTable4fora detailedsummaryofbaseline characteristics. Similar distribution of CRPS (DRG: 44/76 [57.9%]; SCS: 43/76 [56.6%]) and causalgia (DRG: 32/76 [42.1%]; SCS: 33/76 [43.4%]) was reported between the arms. All CRPS subjects had sensory symptoms, 82/87 (94.3%) had motor trophic symptoms, 57/87 (65.5%) had vasomotor symptoms, and 58/87 (66.7%) had sudomotor or edema symptoms. A total of 79 of the 87 CRPS subjects had at least one symptom in each of 3 symptom categories documented at baseline; 8 CRPS subjects (3 in the DRG group and 5 in the SCS group) had one symptom ineachof 2symptomcategories documented at the time of the baseline evaluation (sensory and motor).

For subjects diagnosed with causalgia the injured nerves are documented in Table 5. 3.3. Primary composite end point Figure 3 summarizes the primary composite end point results at 3 months, when the primary end point was ascertained, as well as over time through 12 months. No neurological deficits were reported during the study, so the rates of success at each time point include those subjects with a permanent implant who reported at least a 50% reduction in VAS from preimplant levels. Randomized subjects who did not proceed to permanent implant were considered treatment failures for this end point at each study visit. The proportion of subjects who achieved treatment success at 3 months in the DRG arm (81.2%; 56/69) was statistically greater than the SCS arm (55.7%; 39/70). The results demonstrated that DRG stimulation met not only noninferiority (P , 0.0001) but also statistical superiority (P , 0.0004). Long term, the proportion of subjects who achievedtreatmentsuccess at 12 monthsin theDRG arm (74.2%; 49/66) also was greater than that in the SCS arm (53.0%; 35/66); theseresults demonstrated both noninferiority (P , 0.0001) and superiority (P , 0.0004) at the long-term follow-up. Similar results were observed at 3 months when the primary end point was stratified by primary diagnoses. For CRPS, a greater proportion of DRG subjects (82.5%) met the primary end point at 3 months than SCS subjects (57.5%) (noninferiority, P , 0.001; superiority, P 5 0.006). For causalgia, the proportion of subjects who met the primary end point was higher for DRG (79.3%) than for SCS (53.3%) (noninferiority, P 5 0.001; superiority, P 5 0.014). 3.4. Secondary end point On average, DRG subjects experienced significantly less postural variation in perceived paresthesia intensity than the SCS subjects (P , 0.001) at 3 months. Dorsal root ganglion subjects reported a mean difference between supine and upright paresthesia intensity rating of 20.1 6 1.6, and SCS subjects had a mean difference of 1.8 6 3.0. These results persisted throughout the study (Fig. 4). 3.5. Other end points 3.5.1. Short-Form-36 Table 6 summarizes the SF-36 results. Both the DRG stimulation and SCS groups experienced improvements in SF-36 scores from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05) and 12 months, with the one exception that the General Health scale was not significantly improved at 12 months in the SCS group (P . 0.05). At 3 months, the change in the mental health dimension was statistically better for DRG stimulation subjects compared to SCS subjects (P 5 0.0295). At12 months, DRG subjects had statistically greater improvement on 3 scales: overall change in the physical component score (P 5 0.04), general health (P 5 0.03), and social functioning (P 5 0.03) when compared to SCS subjects. 3.5.2.

Figure 5 presents the change in POMS scores through the 12-month visit. The changes in POMS scores from baseline to 3 months were statistically greater for DRG subjects than for SCS subjects for the Total Mood Disturbance scale (P 5 0.0466) and the tension domain (P 5 0.0430). Specifically, the Total Mood Disturbance at 3 months improved by a magnitude of 20.4 points (29.0 at baseline to 8.6 at 3 months) for DRG subjects, and only a magnitude of 14.7 points (25.6 at baseline to 10.9 at 3 months) for SCS subjects. These improvements in the Total Mood Disturbance and tension domain score for DRG subjects persisted to 12 months (P 5 0.021 and P 5 0.004, respectively). In addition, at 12 months, the depression (P 5 0.004) and confusion (P 5 0.020) domains also demonstrated statistically greater magnitudes of improvement for DRG subjects compared to the improvements for SCS subjects. 3.5.3. Brief pain inventory As shown in Table 7, both groups experienced improvements in all of the BPI scales from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05) and 12 months (P , 0.05). Between the 2 groups, improvements from baseline on the interference scale (treatment 4.2, control 3.0), the activity scale (treatment 4.5, control 3.4), and the affective scale (treatment 3.8, control 2.5) were statistically greater (P , 0.05) for DRG subjects compared to SCS subjects at 3 months. These results persisted to 12 months. 3.5.4. Subject satisfaction The majority of patients in both groups reported high degrees of satisfaction (Table 8) for all 4 satisfaction items. However, no statistical significance was found between the groups for all items assessed (P . 0.05). 3.5.5. Stimulation specificity At 3 months, SCS subjects were 2.3 times more likely to report feeling paresthesia in one or more nonpainful areas as DRG subjects (35.2% vs 15.3%, P 5 0.0142). At 12 months postim- plant, SCS subjects were 7.1 times more likely to report feeling paresthesia in one or more nonpainful areas as DRG subjects (38.8% vs 5.5%, P , 0001). The percent of subjects who reported that they felt paresthesia in only their painful region(s) at 3 and 12 months was 84.7% and 94.5% in the DRG group, and 64.8% and 61.2% in the SCS group. 3.5.6. Percentage change in visual analog scale As shown in Table 9, DRG stimulation demonstrated a greater mean percent reduction in VAS scores than SCS (84.1% vs 70.9%, respectively) with the significant reduction persisting to 6 months and 12 months. Subjects using DRG reported mean VAS of 80.6 mm at baseline, which reduced to 13.1 mm at 3 months and remained low, at 15.0 mm, at 12 months. The subjects using SCS reported a baseline mean VAS of 80.7, 3-month mean VAS of 23.8 mm, and 12-month mean VAS of 26.5 mm. 3.6. Safety analysis A total of 21 SAEs occurred in 19 subjects (8 DRG subjects and 11 SCS subjects). The rates of SAEs were 10.5% (8/76) in the DRG arm and 14.5% (11/76) in the SCS arm. The difference in the rate of SAEs between groups was not statistically different (P 5 0.62). Two of the SAEs in the control group were adjudicated as definitely related to the implant procedure. Both events were infections that required device explant. There were no unanticipated SAEs or stimulation-induced neurological deficits at any time during the study. None of the subjects died. Table 10 presents the rates of related AEs. Fifty two procedure-related events were reported by 35 patients (46.1%) in the DRG arm, and 29 procedure-related events were reported by 20 patients (26.3%) in the SCS arm, yielding a statistically significant difference between the groups (P 5 0.018). Possible Figure 3. Proportion of subjects in each group who met the primary end point. The proportion of subjects who met the composite end point of success defined as 50% or greater pain reduction at both the trial phase and the indicated follow-up visit without a stimulation-related neurological deficit in the modified intent-to-treat population is shown. Subjects who exited the study after randomization were considered treatment failures. At all study visits, the proportion of subjects in the DRG stimulation group with successful therapy was noninferior to SCS (Blackwelder test of 2 proportions, all P , 0.01).

Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® contributors to the differential rate of procedure-related AEs are the procedure times and number of leads. Procedure times for permanent implant averaged 107.2 minutes (651.2) for DRG subjects and 75.7 minutes (632.2) for SCS subjects. In addition, 16.4% (10/61) of DRG subjects were implanted with 3 or 4 leads, while all SCS subjects had 1 or 2 leads implanted. For both groups, the most frequently occurring procedure-related AE was pain at the incision sites with 7 events reported by 6 patients (7.9%) in the DRG arm and 5 events reported by 5 patients (6.6%) in the SCS arm. For device-related AEs, 39 events were reported by 28 patients (36.8%) in the DRG arm and 24 events were reported by 20 patients (26.3%) in the SCS arm. No statistical difference was found between the groups (P 5 0.22). The most frequently occurring device-related AE in the DRG arm was implantable pulse generator (IPG) pocket pain with 10 events reported by 10 patients (13.2%). On the other hand, the most frequently occurring device- related AE in the SCS arm was loss of stimulation due to lead migration with 8 events reported by 8 (10.5%) patients. There was also no statistical difference between the groups for stimulation-related AEs (P 5 0.8025). Ten events were reported by 8 patients (10.5%) in the DRG arm, and 10 events were reported by 10 patients (13.2%) in the SCS arm. The most frequently occurring stimulation-related AE for both groups was overstimulation with 3 events reported by 3 patients (3.9%) in the DRG arm and 5 events reported by 5 patients (6.6%) in the SCS arm.

Discussion This study represents the largest randomized controlled trial assessing DRG stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable painassociatedwiththe diagnosesof CRPSorcausalgia.Analysis of the primary end point revealed that subjects using DRG stimulation had a higher rate of treatment success (81.2%) compared with the treatment success rate for traditional SCS (56.7%). Furthermore, pain relief persisted through 12 months of follow-up and remained significantly lower for DRG subjects than for those using SCS. Subjects using DRG reported significantly less postural-related changes in paresthesia and showed larger improvements on measures of quality of life, functional status, and psychological disposition than subjects using SCS. The safety profile of the DRG stimulation device was similar to traditional SCS devices, with the exception of the rate of procedural events. These results for DRG stimulation as a treatment of chronic neuropathic pain associated with CRPS and causalgia must be interpreted within the context of previous neurostimulation studies for this population. Treatment of chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy with SCS,in combination with physical therapy, reduced pain to a greater degree than physical therapy alone14; mean VAS scores for implanted patients reduced to 3.5 cm on a 10-cm VAS scale after 6 months of SCS. A retrospective analysis of SCS for the treatment of CRPS reported a mean VAS of 5.6 cm over a mean follow-up time of 88 months.19 Mean VAS scores during SCS therapy in both these previous studies were higher, by a clinically meaningful margin10 than the VAS score of 13.1 mm and 15 mm reported by subjects treated with DRG stimulation in our study at 3 and 12 months. Similarly, Geurts et al.11 reported only a 50% pain reduction in an observational trial of SCS for CRPS. Figure 5. Change in profile of mood states (POMS) at 12 months.

Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® A study using a heterogeneous population, including subjects with CRPS, reported that 68.4% of subjects were able to achieve $50% leg pain relief, and 60% of subjects achieved $50% pain relief for overall pain.21 A published case series of CRPS subjects reported that 71.4% of subjects achieved $50% pain relief after 6 months of DRG stimula- tion.28 In addition, a randomized trial comparing SCS to physical therapy for subjects with CRPS reported that 50% of subjects achieved at least 50% reduction in pain intensity.14 Here, we report an 84% reduction in pain for patients treated with DRG stimulation and that 81% of subjects achieved $50% pain relief. Furthermore, the optimal programming for DRG stimulation is still being developed; Table 2 shows that SCS and DRG parameters were quite different. Additional developments in optimized programming for DRG should improve clinical outcomes over time for this therapy. Taken together, we conclude that DRG stimulation provides better pain relief than traditional SCS. Patients with CRPS and causalgia are difficult to treat with symptoms for 20% to 80% of CRPS I patients persisting for 1 year, even when treatment was considered successful.2 Surgical interventions such as joint denervation or neurolysis also have variable outcomes; approximately 20% of patients failed to report low pain intensity and improved activities of daily living 2 years after surgery.9 For patients with CRPS I or causalgia who do not achieve adequate pain management with conservative therapies, SCS provides an additional and reversible treatment option.

April 2017·Volume 158·Number 4 www.painjournalonline.com 679 providing a therapy that is adaptable to each patient’s individual pain profile through more precise anatomical targeting. The pathways for sensory afferents into the central nervous system via the DRG are well documented.4,13 Anatomically, peripheral inputs associated with pain symptoms can be traced to relevant DRG at one or more spinal levels. Stimulation of the relevant DRG modifies pain signaling from the periphery for only the affected dermatomes. By contrast, SCS targets large dermatomal areas through stimulation of the dorsal column at anatomically defined spinal levels, and, as such, modifies ascending pathways for pain while also modulating collateral afferents in or near the medial lemniscus. Modulating pain signals from distal appendages with SCS typically requires that multiple dermatomes be captured–with paresthesias in the entire region. Our results showed that subjects treated with DRG stimulation had significantly less perceived stimulation sensation in nonpainful areas than subjects using SCS, while reporting better pain relief. This may indicate more precision targeting by virtue of the greater anatomical specificity with DRG stimulation. The differences in collateral paresthesia may also be influenced by differences in programming parameters. Programming param- eters were individualized for each subject’s optimal experience. The resulting parameters were quite different between the 2 therapies (Table 2) with much lower amplitudes for DRG programming. This was expected from pilot work7 and because diffusion of energy by the cerebrospinal fluid is less influential at the DRG. The between-subjects design of this study prohibits a real comparison of the relationship between targeting, programming, and pain relief; more research is needed. Chronic pain conditions, in general, are associated with disturbances in mood and physical and social functioning.1,22,24 The targeted pain relief provided by DRG stimulation in the ACCURATE study was also associated with additional benefits. After 3 months, subjects using DRG stimulation reported significantly greater improvements in total mood disturbance, as measured by the POMS, as well as larger improvements pain interference, affective disruption, and activity, as measured by the BPI. Moreover, by 12 months, subjects treated with DRG stimulation reported significantly larger improvements than SCS subjects for physical function, general health, and social function, as measured by the SF-36. Despite the differences reported for treatment success, pain relief, and affective or functional outcomes, the majority of subjects were satisfied with their respective therapy, regardless of treatment group. While subjects using DRG stimulation reported a larger magnitude of change and there was a greater proportion of successfulsubjectswithDRGstimulation,SCSsubjects,asagroup, did report significant improvements from baseline in all measured domains. The satisfaction results reported here reflect the improve- ments from preimplant baseline experienced by subjects. The rate of AEs for DRG stimulation, through 12 months postimplant, was similar to that seen for the SCS-treated subjects in this study and in previous reports.17,20 Only 2 subjects had procedure-related SAEs; 2 infections in the SCS group that required explant. It is notable that the rate of nonserious procedure-related events was higher for the DRG stimulation group (46%) compared with the SCS group (26%). The higher rate of procedure-related events may be attributed to the differences in average procedure time and a greater number of leads placed for DRG some subjects, which may increase exposure to risk. It is expected that additional experience with DRG implantation will result in shorter procedure times and fewer procedure-related events. There are limitations to this study that may affect the interpretation of the results. The calculated success rate was contingent upon subjects not only achieving 50% pain relief but also continuing in the study (dropouts were counted as failures). Therefore, the success rate could be influenced by factors associated with the lack of blinded treatments (eg, SCS subjects were less motivated to stay in the trial, uncontrolled differences in health care provider interactions). In addition, subjects were required to maintain a stable regimen of pain medications through 3 months only, and the long-term results after 3 months may be affected by medication changes. The SCS device also had limitations placed on the programming of the device so that the comparison between the devices was not confounded by unique SCS device programming features. In particular, the accelerom- eter function in the SCS device was disabled. If the accelerometer was enabled, the SCS group may have had less postural changes in perceived paresthesia intensity. In addition, the analysis of subjects who did and did not experience paresthesia when stimulation was on was confounded by the fact that the SCS device instruction for use requires the device to be programmed for subjects to receive paresthesia. In addition, the number of subjects who did not have paresthesia is very small, and this end point was not adequately powered to detect the difference in pain relief for subjects who reported feeling vs not feeling paresthesia. In conclusion, CRPS I and causalgia, in their chronic forms, are difficult to treat with variable outcomes with conservative symptom management. Neuromodulation techniques, like SCS, may benefit many patients who have exhausted other therapy options. SCS, however, often has a limited ability to target discrete focal anatomical regions of pain, as is common in CRPS and causalgia. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation provides an effective alternative that provides precision stimulation targeting and improved patient outcomes.

Successful clinical application of SCS is presumed to be generally dependent  on maximizing paresthesia-pain overlap; critical to achieving this is positioning of the stimulation  field at the physiologic midline. Recently, the necessity of paresthesia for achieving effective relief  in SCS has been challenged by the introduction of 10 kHz paresthesia-free stimulation. In a large,  prospective, randomized controlled pivotal trial, HF10 therapy was demonstrated to be statistically  and clinically superior to paresthesia-based SCS in the treatment of severe chronic low back and  leg pain. HF10 therapy, unlike traditional paresthesia-based SCS, requires no paresthesia to be  experienced by the patient, nor does it require paresthesia mapping at any point during lead  implant or post-operative programming. Objectives: To determine if pain relief was related to technical factors of paresthesia, we measured  and analyzed the paresthesia responses of patients successfully using HF10 therapy. Study Design: Prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, non-controlled interventional study. Setting: Outpatient pain clinic at 10 centers across the US and Italy. Methods: Patients with both back and leg pain already implanted with an HF10 therapy device  for up to 24 months were included in this multicenter study. Patients provided pain scores prior to  and after using HF10 therapy. Each patient’s most efficacious HF10 therapy stimulation program  was temporarily modified to a low frequency (LF; 60 Hz), wide pulse width (~470 μs), paresthesia- generating program. On a human body diagram, patients drew the locations of their chronic  intractable pain and, with the modified program activated, all regions where they experienced LF  paresthesia. Paresthesia and pain drawings were then analyzed to estimate the correlation of pain  relief outcomes to overlap of pain by paresthesia, and the mediolateral distribution of paresthesia  (as a surrogate of physiologic midline lead positioning). Results: A total of 61 patients participated across 11 centers. Twenty-eight men and 33 women  with a mean age of 56 ± 12 years of age participated in the study. The average duration of  implantable pulse generator (IPG) implant was 19 ± 9 months. The average predominant pain  score, as measured on a 0 – 10 visual analog scale (VAS), prior to HF10 therapy was 7.8 ± 1.3 and  at time of testing was 2.5 ± 2.1, yielding an average pain relief of 70 ± 24%. For all patients, the  mean paresthesia coverage of pain was 21 ± 28%, with 43% of patients having zero paresthesia  coverage of pain. Analysis revealed no correlation between percentage of LF paresthesia overlap  of predominant pain and HF10 therapy efficacy (P = 0.56). Exact mediolateral positioning of  the stimulation electrodes was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of pain relief  outcomes. Limitations: Non-randomized/non-controlled study design; short-term evaluation; certain  technical factors not investigated.

Four decades of experience with implantable pulse  generators (IPG) delivering low frequency electrical  stimulation directly to the nerve fibers in the spine has  benefited thousands of people (6-8). Melzack & Wall’s  Gate Control Theory  of 1965 (9) provided a basis for the  stimulation strategy in SCS:  supra-threshold stimulation  of large, myelinated A-beta afferent fiber projections in  the dorsal column. Activation of these fibers would, in  turn, excite inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn  through (at least) a monosynaptic connection with local  dorsal column collaterals (10). The activated inhibitory  interneurons would then pre-synaptically inhibit both  small and large fiber connections to pain transmission  neurons, thus reducing activity in central pain pathways.  Additionally, increased A-beta fiber activity would,  through projections to rostral central nuclei in the  brainstem, trigger activity in descending circuits, which  could further inhibit segmental pain transmission.  Inspired by the Gate Control Theory, Shealy et al (11)  implanted the first electrodes in humans in 1967, and  demonstrated effective pain relief in a small number of  patients.  Activation of the particular A-beta fiber collater- als in the dorsal column that communicate with the  primary and referred dorsal horn pain circuitry is key  to the ostensible pain gating mechanism (12). Thus, the  clinical goal of traditional SCS is to induce comfortable  paresthesia (defined as any abnormal sensation caused  by A-beta stimulation; including what is often perceived  by patients as tingling, buzzing, pins and needles, pres- sure, etc.) that overlaps the existing distribution of  pain (13-18). Successful clinical application of SCS has  shown to be generally dependent on paresthesia-based  outcomes: maximal paresthesia-pain overlap as well as  patient acceptance of the induced sensations (16,19,20).  Overlap of pain by paresthesia is dependent upon  many factors: patient anatomy, stimulation lead posi- tioning, stimulation program parameters, etc. Certain  body regions appear relatively simple to superimpose  with paresthesia, while others are more challenging.  For example, from a mid- to low-thoracic dorsal epi- dural position, regions such as the anterior legs and ab- domen will frequently be covered by paresthesia, but,  due to spinal anatomy and neurophysiology, coverage  of the low back is difficult (21,22). A crucial factor to successful paresthesia targeting  is a physiological midline positioning of the stimulation  field (23-26). Activation of dorsal root fibers, which can  cause uncomfortable, intense segmental sensations,  is believed to limit the ability to recruit deeply in the  dorsal columns (27). North et al have clinically demon- strated that stimulating contacts positioned precisely  on physiologic midline (defined as the mediolateral  epidural anatomical position over the dorsal columns  which results in left-right balanced body paresthesia)  has demonstrated statistically significantly better par- esthesia-pain overlap than techniques which generate  off-midline stimulation fields (25,28,29). The sensation of paresthesia is usually well-tol- erated by patients, but it can become bothersome or  even dysesthetic. Paresthesia can disturb sleep, may be  experienced as excessive and uncomfortable, and is sen- sitive to body position (5,30,31). As a result, stimulator  technology has been developed to adapt the paresthe- sia sensations such that they are less disruptive to the  patient experience of paresthesia-based SCS (32,33). More recently, however, the necessity of paresthesia  for achieving effective relief in SCS has been removed by  the introduction of 10 kHz paresthesia-free stimulation  (34,35). In a large, prospective, randomized controlled  pivotal trial, HF10 therapy has been demonstrated to be  statistically and clinically superior to paresthesia-based  SCS in the treatment of severe chronic low back and  leg pain (36,37). This Level 1 evidence was established  after prior long-term prospective clinical studies and  worldwide clinical experience in thousands of patients  had suggested that HF10 therapy provided robust relief  of chronic pain (38,39). HF10 therapy, unlike traditional  www.painphysicianjournal.com   333 Paresthesia-Independent Spinal Cord Stimulation Pain Relief Patients provided pain scores using either VAS or verbal numeric  rating scale (for any individual patient, the pain score instrument  used remained consistent throughout the study) for predominant  pain areas. One cohort of patients (N = 20) provided a single pain  score for their back and leg pain, whereas the remaining patients  (N = 41) provided individual pain scores for back and leg pain. In  order to pool the data, in the latter group, the predominant pain  region was defined as the region assigned the higher pain score at  pre-implant. In 3 of these patients, leg and back pain scores were  equal, and so the back region was defined as predominant; this was  the more conservative choice in all cases. Scores were obtained at the  visit prior to receiving SCS (pre-HF10 therapy) and at the follow-up  visit when programming and drawings were obtained (follow-up).  Pain relief from pre-HF10 therapy to follow-up was then calculated  as 100*(PainScoreBaseline – PainScoreFollow-Up)/PainScoreBaseline. Pain and Paresthesia Drawings At follow-up, patients were asked to indicate their favorite/most  effective HF10 therapy program. The frequency and pulse width pa- paresthesia-based SCS, requires no pares- thesia to be experienced by the patient,  nor does it require paresthesia mapping  at any point during lead implant or post- operative programming. Given the absence of paresthesia in  its clinical application, it is not known if  HF10 therapy follows the same techni- cal requirements as found historically in  traditional, paresthesia-based SCS. There- fore, we measured and analyzed the par- esthesia responses of patients successfully  using HF10 therapy to determine if 10 kHz  paresthesia-free SCS was dependent upon  paresthesia-pain overlap and position  relative to the physiologic midline. Methods Patients Patients already permanently im- planted with a Senza system (Nevro Corp.,  Redwood City, CA) and receiving HF10  therapy for chronic intractable low back  and/or leg pain were enrolled. The system  included an IPG and two 8-contact per- cutaneous leads positioned anatomically  at radiographic midline in the dorsal epi- dural space between the T8-T11 vertebral  levels. In the United States, 41 patients  already participating in the SENZA-RCT  for pain in the trunk and leg (5) were  asked if they wanted to participate in  this sub-study. Most of the paresthesia  measurements were made at the patients’  24-month follow-up visit. In Italy, 20 pa- tients were selected from a single site that  was utilizing the Senza system through  commercial means to treat back and/or  leg pain. These patients were consented  to this trial using an ethics committee  (St. Chiara Hospital, Pisa, Italy) approved  protocol. Paresthesia measurements were  made at follow-up visits ranging from 0.25  – 27 months post-IPG implant. Informed  consent was obtained on all patients and  the study protocol and informed consent  forms were approved by each study site’s  applicable institutional review board. Fig. 1.

Pain Physician: May/June 2017: 20:331-341 334   www.painphysicianjournal.com rameters for this program were then changed to 60 Hz  and 467 ± 141 µs, creating a modified program that de- livered low frequency (LF) stimulation from sites in the  spine where therapeutic HF10 therapy was delivered.  While in a seated position, patients were asked to  draw on a commonly used human body diagram print- ed on paper (Fig. 1) all the regions of pain for which  they were using therapeutic SCS. Next, the pulse ampli- tude of the modified program was increased in 0.1 mA  steps to 2 levels: (a) first perception of LF paresthesia,  and (b) a drawing threshold (defined in each patient as  either 150% of this perception threshold or a maximum  comfortable intensity indicated by the patient, which- ever was smaller). At the drawing threshold setting,  patients were then asked to draw the bodily locations  where they experienced LF paresthesia. For patients  using multi-area programs, each stimulation area was  activated individually and a LF paresthesia drawing was  obtained for that area alone.    Analysis Pain and LF paresthesia drawings were scanned at  300 dpi for each patient. After scanning, all drawings  were brought into ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). At 400x  magnification, pain regions, LF paresthesia regions, and  overlap were measured by creating closed freeform pe- rimeters surrounding the respective areas; 3 measure- ments of total pixels contained by each region were  made and averaged to form an estimate. For patients  using multi-area programs, the paresthesia drawings  for all stimulation program areas were first merged  before total pixels were measured. Similarly, overlap  of LF paresthesia and pain regions was generated by  electronically superimposing (as needed; the majority  of the drawings collected had pain and paresthesia  drawn on separate figures requiring electronic super- imposition, though many (43%) drawings did not need  electronic image consolidation) the scanned pain and  consolidated paresthesia drawings. Overlaid images  were co-registered as necessary using rigid translation  and elastic registration tools (bUnwarpJ) to correct any  offsets or distortion in scanning and to assure body  perimeter concordance between drawings. Summary  statistics of stimulation current amplitude thresholds  were also calculated.  Low back pain is of special interest in SCS, and cover- age of this region with LF paresthesia is known to be  difficult. As there is no standard definition of the “low  back,” an aggregate “low back region” was defined  based upon several literature sources (22,40-43). The re- gion defined here was bordered rostrally by the bottom  of the rib cage, and caudally at the start of the gluteal  cleft, centered on the line of the iliac crest, and spread- ing bilaterally stopping just short of the hips (Fig. 1).  Paresthesia-Pain Overlap To determine if there was a relationship between  LF paresthesia-pain overlap from HF10 therapy stimula- tion sites and HF10 therapy efficacy, a linear regression  analysis (Real Statistics Resource Pack [Release 4.3],  Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA) (44) was performed  between estimated LF paresthesia overlap and HF10  therapy pain relief across all patients. Mediolateral Distribution of Pain and  Paresthesia The laterality of pain and paresthesia was defined  by first bisecting the human figure drawing from groin  to cranial apex, and counting anterior and posterior  pixels on each body side. The percentage of left-side  and right-side paresthesia was calculated as %LeftS- ide = 100*LeftSidePixels/TotalPixels and %RightSide  = 100%-%LeftSide, respectively. The mediolateral  distribution, or laterality, of the pain and paresthe- sia was then defined as the larger of %LeftSide and  %RightSide. For example, if %LeftSide(Paresthesia) =  73%, then %RightSide(Paresthesia) = 27%, and then  the paresthesia laterality = 73%. With this definition,  paresthesia laterality of 50% would be balanced par- esthesia to both sides of the body, and paresthesia  laterality of 100% would be completely unilateral  paresthesia. Results A total of 61 patients participated across 11 cen- ters. The mean age and gender was 56 ± 12 years and  M28/F33, respectively. Patients had been diagnosed  with chronic intractable back and/or leg pain for 14 ±  9 years. The average duration of IPG implant was 19.4  ± 8.6 months.  The average predominant pain score prior to HF10  therapy was 7.8 ± 1.3 and at time of testing was 2.5 ±  2.1, yielding an average pain relief of 70 ± 24%. Stimulation Over 75% of patients were tested at pulse width of  500 µs, and the mean LF paresthesia perception thresh- old for this pulse width setting was 2.7 ± 1.4 mA. The  ratio between the mean drawing amplitude and the LF  perception threshold was 1.3 ± 0.2.  www.painphysicianjournal.com   335 Paresthesia-Independent Spinal Cord Stimulation Pain and LF Paresthesia Distributions and  HF10 Therapy Efficacy Thirty patients (49%) had “back only” or “back >  leg” pain, 12 patients (20%) had “back = leg” pain, and  19 patients (31%) had “leg > back” or “leg only” pain.  Ninety-seven percent of patients drew pain regions  that included the axial low back region, while only 44%  of patients drew any paresthesia in this region. For all  patients, the mean paresthesia coverage of all pain was  21 ± 28%, with 43% of patients having zero paresthesia  coverage of pain. Patients who did demonstrate pares- thesia coverage averaged 36 ± 29% coverage of painful  areas. To explore the relationship between efficacy of  HF10 therapy and the mediolateral position of the spi- nal stimulation site across all patients, summary statis- tics of the paresthesia laterality were first compiled for  all patients. This resulted in a bimodal histogram (Fig.  2), where it was observed that the 2 prominent modes  were medial (generally located between 50% and 79%  paresthesia laterality) and lateral (located from 80% to  100% paresthesia laterality). Patients were then cat- egorized into these 2 groups and their mean pain relief  was compared. Summary statistics of pain relief were  then calculated for both groups and compared (Mann- Whitney U, 2-tailed). From each patient’s paresthesia and pain laterality,  it was then determined if they had both a side of ma- Fig. 2. Distribution of  paresthesia laterality for all patients. The horizontal axis indicates the calculated paresthesia laterality  independent of  sidedness. Beneath the horizontal axis are shown examples of  patient drawings, (where paresthesia drawing  is colored blue and pain is colored red) approximately aligned with the axis position of  the calculated paresthesia laterality for  that drawing: at 50% paresthesia laterality, the far left drawing shows that paresthesia is well-balanced between left and right;  the middle drawing shows bilateral posterior paresthesia but asymmetric anterior thigh paresthesia, resulting in a paresthesia  laterality of  75%; at the far right, all paresthesia is confined to the right hip, which resulted in a 100% paresthesia laterality.

This  subset of patients were then cat- egorized into 2 groups:  IPSILAT- ERAL: majority pain and major- ity paresthesia on the same body  side; CONTRALATERAL: majority  pain and majority paresthesia on  opposite body sides. Again, sum- mary statistics of pain relief were  then calculated for both of these  groups and compared (Mann- Whitney U, 2-tailed). As shown in Fig. 2, correlation  revealed no relationship between  % LF paresthesia overlap of pre- dominant pain and HF10 therapy  efficacy, r(59) = 0.08, P = 0.56.  Mean pain laterality was 70 ±  18% and mean paresthesia later- ality was 78 ± 22%.  When all pa- tients were divided into those with  grossly medial paresthesia and  those with lateral paresthesia and  their outcomes compared, pain re- lief was not significantly different  (P = 0.77) between groups (Fig. 4). A total of 30 patients (64%)  could be categorized into groups  of either paresthesia ipsilateral (N  = 18) or contralateral to predomi- nant pain (N = 12). The average  pain relief in the ipsilateral group  was 73 ± 22% and 66 ± 25% in  the contralateral group, and these  were not statistically significantly  different (P = 0.48) (Fig. 5). discussion In traditional low frequency  SCS, paresthesia is known to be the  key technical outcome predictive  of pain relief (45). Its importance  is such that much of the research  and technology development of  the last 40+ years of SCS has been  focused on improving the control  of paresthesia. Fig. 3.

Pain relief  was not significantly different between groups, P = 0.77 www.painphysicianjournal.com   337 Paresthesia-Independent Spinal Cord Stimulation Research In the decades following Shealy  et al’s initial work (11), the nature of  paresthesia coverage of pain due to  programming, lead placement, lead  design, and stimulation technology  was investigated. In the 1980s, Law  established the value of optimizing  the active contact combinations on  multiple implanted electrodes when  targeting difficult body regions such  as the low back (23,46). In the 1990s,  Barolat et al (22) created a paresthesia  atlas which linked vertebral lead loca- tion to the likelihood of paresthesia  coverage of particular body areas. In  the 2000s, North et al published mul- tiple studies, comparing percutaneous  leads to paddle electrodes, single lead  vs dual parallel lead implants, as well  as demonstrating the efficiencies of  patient-interactive programming sys- tems that guided the patient through  programming to optimize paresthe- sia coverage (19,25,42,47-49). And  throughout these decades, computa- tional modeling of epidural SCS con- tributed not only to the understanding  of the impact of lead position, contact  size, spacing, and orientation on dorsal  column activation, but also suggested  new lead designs and stimulation ar- chitectures that might provide better  paresthesia targeting (50-52). Technology In response to these technical  research findings, many technologies  in SCS were introduced with the goal  of selectively stimulating the axons in  the dorsal column to provide better  paresthesia coverage of each patient’s  pain. In general, this usually resulted in  increased complexity, which required  ever more sophisticated systems to  tractably manage the massive flex- ibility of programming these new  systems. New SCS system features  included  increased  numbers  and  orientations of stimulating contacts,  increased numbers of stimulation channels within the pulse generators,  and programming systems that allowed for steering of stimulation cur- rent (5,21,53). Other newer technologies attempt to adapt the stimula- tion programming to better manage the paresthesia. One such system  employs an accelerometer in the IPG which, when it detected postural  changes by the patient, would alter the stimulation program parameters  to maintain a more stable paresthesia intensity (31,54). More recently,  the measurement of evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) from  SCS-activated A-beta dorsal column fibers has been used as a surrogate  for paresthesia strength. The amplitude of these ECAPs, measured on  the implanted SCS electrodes, provides a servo-like feedback variable to  the SCS IPG allowing rapid and sophisticated automatic adjustment of  stimulation amplitude to hold paresthesia sensation relatively constant  during the patient’s activities of daily living (33,55).  HF10 therapy, however, uniquely has paresthesia-free SCS labeling  approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Stimulation leads are  placed using only fluoroscopic imaging at radiographic midline spanning  empirically established vertebral landmarks, depending upon the pain  location. As a result, there is no need to wake patients for paresthesia  assessments during intraoperative placement. Paresthesia fitting is not  Fig. 5. Comparison of  relief  of  predominant pain for patients grouped by  agreement between majority pain and majority paresthesia. Patients in the  ipsilateral group had majority pain and majority paresthesia on the same side  of  the body. Patients in the contralateral group, who had majority pain on the  opposite side of  the body as majority paresthesia. The difference in pain relief   between the 2 groups was not statistically significant, P = 0.48. Pain Physician: May/June 2017: 20:331-341 338   www.painphysicianjournal.com done and there is no concern for coverage of pain- ful areas with a stimulation sensation. To determine  best pain relief, a series of programs are stored in the  patient’s remote control and the patient is guided to  attempt each program over several hours to days to as- sess the degree of pain relief achieved. Throughout all  initial stimulation adjustments and regular clinical use,  patients using HF10 therapy for back and leg pain never  experience a paresthesia (35). This contrast between the dependence of tradi- tional LF SCS on paresthesia and the frank absence of  paresthesia from any aspect of HF10 therapy provided  the impetus to study 2 paresthesia-based technical fac- tors in patients receiving HF10 therapy: paresthesia-pain  overlap and mediolateral paresthesia distributions (as a  marker of contact orientation to physiologic midline). Paresthesia-Pain Overlap Across all patients, we observed very little mean  paresthesia overlap of pain (21 ± 28%) using LF stimula- tion from HF10 therapy contacts. Approximately 40%  of patients reported zero paresthesia-pain coverage;  those who did report overlap had a low mean value (36  ± 29%). This result is consistent with the observation  that most (96%) of the patients drew classic bilateral  axial back pain patterns, but only 44% drew any pares- thesia in the low back region. Inference from North et al’s Fig. 2 suggests that pa- tients having these low levels of overlap in traditional  LF SCS would be expected to achieve no greater than  20% – 30% pain relief (perhaps lower, since a meta- analysis of overlap ratings and pain relief suggests that  percent pain relief is often less than percent overlap  on a numerical basis) (28,29,45,47). However, the mean  pain relief for these patients was approximately 70%  using HF10 therapy from these same contacts. Comparison of percent pain relief versus percent LF  paresthesia overlap of pain demonstrated no correla- tion between the variables (Fig. 2). This again stands in  contrast to the weak but significant positive correlation  observed by North et al (45) in traditional LF SCS over a  similar follow-up period. Mediolateral Distribution of Pain and Paresthesia Physiological midline positioning of stimulation  leads is considered important in the treatment of pa- tients with low back pain (22,42). The primary rationale  is that midline positioning enables a maximal penetra- tion depth of the dorsal columns by the stimulation  field prior to activation of dorsal roots (27,56). If the  dorsal column is maximally recruited, the patient may  report very broad areas of paresthesia perceived in  their body and this increases the likelihood of covering  complex pain distributions. Our results suggest that at least half of the patients  we studied using HF10 therapy had their efficacious  stimulating contacts unilaterally positioned. The distri- bution of paresthesia in Fig. 2 shows that 26 patients  had 100% paresthesia laterality, indicating that their  LF paresthesia was completely confined to one side  of their body, yet 14 of these patients indicated clear  bilateral distribution (≤ 75% laterality) of their pain.  When we split our studied population into medial and  lateral groups based on their LF paresthesia drawings,  and compared the pain relief, we observed no signifi- cant difference in outcome.  Thus, a physiologic midline  position of contact positioning for HF10 therapy ap- pears far less critically important than for traditional LF  paresthesia-based SCS. When comparing the outcomes of those patients  deemed ipsilateral (majority pain and paresthesia on  same side of body) to those grouped as contralateral  (majority pain and majority paresthesia on opposite  sides of the body), there was still no significant differ- ence in the average pain relief (Fig. 5). However, the  contralateral group did appear to have approximately  10% less relief than those in the ipsilateral group, sug- gesting that leads positioned for HF10 therapy should  be positioned near the dorsal midline. However, this  conclusion needs to be explored in a larger sample in  a prospective manner. For the time being, an anatomic  midline placement based solely on intraoperative imag- ing (which ostensibly achieves this goal) has been dem- onstrated to be highly adequate in achieving excellent  long-term pain relief (37,38). Limitations Study Design This was a prospective, non-randomized, non- controlled interventional study of low frequency  paresthesia as a correlate to clinical outcome for HF10  therapy. The stimulation contacts employed were locat- ed at spinal sites empirically optimized up to 24-months  based upon HF10-induced pain relief. The data and  analyses presented here do not definitively rule out the  possibility that paresthesia mapping could guide HF10  programming; the results published here may provide  preliminary data useful in the design of such a study.  Nonetheless, the lack of significant correlation between  www.painphysicianjournal.com   339 Paresthesia-Independent Spinal Cord Stimulation paresthesia-pain concordance (including approximately  40% of patients with zero overlap) suggest that pares- thesia is not correlated to high-kHz SCS pain relief. Patient Follow-up We studied patients over a wide range of post-IPG  follow-up times in the group using HF10 in typical clini- cal practice, while nearly all the patients in the SENZA  RCT clinical study were assessed at their 24-month  follow-up visit. While this variation is not ideal, other  researchers have studied patient groups with even  greater variation (19,45). Additionally, there are no  published definitive assessments of paresthesia cover- age over long-term implant, so the impact of capturing  paresthesia at different time periods post-IPG implant  is unknown.  Lead Position We did not capture the vertebral lead position via  radiographic imaging at the time of paresthesia draw- ings. However, knowledge of anatomic lead position  is not necessarily a precise indicator of paresthesia  distributions (22). This is, in fact, the rationale for in- traoperative paresthesia programming in traditional  SCS; even after anatomic-based placements, lead posi- tion adjustments are typically made based upon verbal  patient feedback about paresthesia locations (29).  In  general, we observed leg, abdomen, and (infrequent)  back paresthesia in patient drawings, which suggested  that the leads were positioned near the dorsal columns  and roots in the low-thoracic region, similar to tradi- tional SCS placements to treat pain in these body areas. Frequency Effects of Paresthesia Coverage We used low frequency, high PW stimulation  parameter settings to map the paresthesia coverage  from the HF10 sweet spot.  However, HF10 therapy uses  high frequency (10 kHz), with a necessarily low PW (30  us). Thus, it might be argued that the paresthesia pat- terns could be different with these parameter settings.  We did not explicitly test paresthesia patterns using  HF10-type parameters, because a PW = 30 us yields  paresthesia thresholds that are sometimes higher than  the maximum current output of the IPG. However, dif- ferences in neural recruitment due to higher frequen- cies are unlikely, as deeper penetration depth into the  dorsal columns (ostensibly leading to more neural re- cruitment) would not be expected since grey and white  matter have fairly constant conductivity over the range  of 60 Hz – 10 kHz (57). Additionally, the use of a wider  PW (250 – 450 us) for paresthesia mapping may have  yielded somewhat different paresthesia maps due to  fiber steering with changed PW, but more likely the use  of a wider PW for mapping increased the paresthesia  coverage that would be expected at PW = 30 us (58,  59). Despite this possibility of overestimated overlap,  we observed no significant correlation between pares- thesia-pain concordance and HF10 therapy pain relief. conclusions In this investigation, we observed no correlation  of LF paresthesia-pain overlap with HF10 therapy ef- ficacy. In addition, we also found that mediolateral  LF paresthesia distributions from HF10 therapy con- tacts did not appear to be related to HF10 therapy  efficacy. Taken together, these technical factors of  paresthesia coverage and stimulation field alignment  with the physiological midline, considered important  in traditional, LF, paresthesia-based SCS, appear to be  relatively inconsequential for successful HF10 therapy  application. These exploratory results suggest that  HF10 therapy is not only paresthesia-free, but may be  paresthesia-independent.

ACCURATE, a pivotal, prospective, multicenter, randomized comparative effectiveness trial, was conducted in 152 subjects diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia in the lower extremities. Subjects received neurostimulation of the DRG or dorsal column (spinal cord stimulation, SCS). The primary end point was a composite of safety and efficacy at 3 months, and subjects were assessed through 12 months for long-term outcomes and adverse events. The predefined primary composite end point of treatment success was met for subjects with a permanent implant who reported 50% or greater decrease in visual analog scale score from preimplant baseline and who did not report any stimulation-related neurological deficits. No subjects reported stimulation-related neurological deficits. The percentage of subjects receiving $50% pain relief and treatment success was greater in the DRG arm (81.2%) than in the SCS arm (55.7%, P , 0.001) at 3 months. Device-related and serious adverse events were not different between the 2 groups. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation also demonstrated greater improvements in quality of life and psychological disposition. Finally, subjects using DRG stimulation reported less postural variation in paresthesia (P , 0.001) and reduced extraneous stimulation in nonpainful areas (P 5 0.014), indicating DRG stimulation provided more targeted therapy to painful parts of the lower extremities. As the largest prospective, randomized comparative effectiveness trial to date, the results show that DRG stimulation provided a higher rate of treatment success with less postural variation in paresthesia intensity compared to SCS. Keywords: Chronic pain, Neurostimulation, Complex regional pain syndrome, Causalgia, Dorsal root ganglion stimulation 1. Introduction The prevalence of neuropathic pain refractory to the current standard of care has been estimated to be 1.5% of the general population.26 Spinal cord stimulation (SCS), for which electrodes are placed into the dorsal epidural space, is an available treatment of a variety of chronic neuropathic pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).8 Specific challenges for SCS remain, especially for pain conditions such as CRPS I and causalgia that differ by etiology and symptom profile from other chronic pain syndromes. An estimated 40% to 50% of CRPS subjects achieved clinically meaningful pain relief with SCS.11,14 Similar rates of successful pain relief are reported for heterogeneous populations that contain a significant CRPS population.23 Less than optimal Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article. a Center for Pain Relief, Charleston, WV, USA, b Marcus Neuroscience Institute, Boca Raton, FL, USA, c St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, CA and Plano, TX, USA, d University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA, e IPM Medical Group, Inc, Walnut Creek, CA, USA, f Neurovations, Napa, CA, USA, g Premier Pain Center, Shrewsbury Township, NJ, USA, h Houston Pain Centers, Houston, TX, USA, i HOPE Research—TPC, Phoenix, AZ, USA, j HOPE Research—LVSP, Las Vegas, NV, USA, k Pain Management Associates, Independence, MO, USA, l Florida Pain, Merritt Island, FL, USA, m Carolinas Pain Institute, Winston-Salem, NC, USA, n Newport Beach Headache and Pain, Newport Beach, CA, USA, o Comprehensive Pain and Rehabilitation, Pascagoula, MS, USA, p Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA, q Holy Cross Hospital, Ft.

Lack of precision with SCS is attributed to shunting of energy by the cerebral spinal fluid, positional variations in stimulation, segmentation of spinal sensory input, and lead migrations postimplantation.18 In some cases, these challenges can be addressed with improved surgical techniques and device pro- gramming, but pain related to CRPS and causalgia remains difficult to treat; many SCS patients do not achieve high-level pain relief, despite efforts to improve techniques and programming.14 The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a key role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain.13 The DRG, located between every spinal nerve and the spinal cord on the posterior root, houses the somas of the primary sensory neurons. These somas process and transmit sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Animal models of chronic pain have shown that pathophysiologic changes occur in the DRG, including altered electrophysiological membrane properties, altered expression of integral membrane proteins, and altered expression of various genes that contribute to the hyperexcitability of neurons.15 The combination of the DRG’s sensory function and accessibility through familiar epidural approaches make it an ideal target for neurostimulation. Pain therapies targeting the DRG included radiofrequency frequency ablation, steroid injections, and ganglionectomy.8 Initial evidence with 8 CRPS patients suggested that DRG stimulation may besuccessful in a larger proportion of subjects than SCS (71% vs 50%).28 Thus, the ACCURATE study, a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, evaluated DRG stimulation compared to SCS stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain of the lower limbs attributed to CRPS or causalgia. 2. Methods Under an Investigational Device Exemption, the ACCURATE study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DRG stimulation compared to traditional SCS for subjects with CRPS or causalgia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01923285). The study was conducted in 22 US sites. Prior to any study initiation, all sites obtained approval from the institutional review board, and subjects were enrolled only after informed consent was obtained. 2.1. Patient selection Subjects who had chronic, intractable neuropathic pain of the lower limbs associated with a diagnosis of CRPS or causalgia were screened and determined to be eligible according to the inclusion or exclusion criteria of the study (Table 1). Patients were diagnosed with CRPS type 1 based on the Budapest criteria.12 Causalgia was defined as a painful condition arising from damage to a nerve resulting in chronic pain, generally restricted to the innervation pattern of the damaged nerve or nerves, which may or may not have secondary symptoms.25 The diagnosis, in every case, was confirmed by an experienced medical monitor (N.M.) for strict adherence to these diagnostic criteria. Briefly, eligible subjects were naive to stimulation, had chronic, intractable pain for at least 6 months, tried and failed at least 2 prior pharmacologic treatments from 2 different drug classes, had stable neurologic function 30 days prior to screening, and were free from psychological pathology that contraindicated an implantable device. Subjects with changing or escalating pain condition or unstable use of pain medication 30 days prior to enrollment were not considered eligible to participate in the study. All subjects’ medical, psychological, and imaging records were evaluated by an independent medical monitor to ensure appropriate patient selection. 2.2. Study design After signing informed consent, subjects underwent a baseline evaluation to determine enrollment eligibility. After enrollment, subjects were randomized to either DRG stimulation (DRG group) or traditional SCS (SCS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Random- ization was based on random, permuted blocks and stratified by study center. The study’s centralized electronic data collection system provided the subjects’ randomized group assignments after subjects were enrolled. Subjects, investigators, and study site staff were not blinded to subjects’ assigned therapy. Subjects proceeded to a temporary trial stimulation phase (ranging from 3 to 30 days based on each site’s standard of care), using the device type stipulated by their randomization. The average trial stimulation phase in the DRG group was 5.8 (SD 2.8) days and 5.8 (SD 5.1) days for the SCS group (P 5 0.206, Wilcoxon test). Successful trial stimulation was determined by the subject achieving at least a 50% lower limb pain relief during the trial phase and expressing a desire to go on to a permanent implant. Subjects who were successful during the trial phase were eligible to continue on to permanent implantation. Subjects who failed the trial stimulation phase were exited from the study. However, data from the trial failures were included as treatment failures for the composite treatment success end point at 3 months and at subsequent time points through 12 months. Subjects in both arms, who achieved a successful outcome during the trial phase, were implanted with a permanent device and were followed for 12 months, with follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postimplant. Subjects were not allowed to change the maximum daily dose of their prescribed chronic lower limb pain medications from baseline to the 3-month follow-up visit at which time the primary and secondary end points were ascertained. Postoperative reprogramming to optimize therapy was allowed for both groups at any time during the study, per standard of care for neuro- modulation devices. Programming occurred by respective companies (Medtronic and Spinal Modulation) under the guid- ance of appropriate clinical and technical industry personnel. 2.3. Description of devices and implant procedures Dorsal root ganglion stimulation was delivered by the AXIUM Neurostimulator System (Spinal Modulation; LLC, Menlo Park, CA, a wholly owned subsidiary of St Jude Medical), which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for spinal column stimulation via epidural and intraspinal lead access to the DRG as an aid in the management of moderate to severe chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs in adult patients with CRPS type I and causalgia. The system is composed of percutaneous leads designed to stimulate the DRG, an external trial pulse generator, and an implantable pulse generator. Traditional SCS was delivered with a commercially available system (RestoreUltra and RestoreSensor; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) indicated for a number of chronic pain conditions including CRPS I and causalgia. Both devices were programmed by separate technicians for each arm such that the programming was performed by experienced personnel for the specific device to achieve optimal analgesia. See Table 2 for a summary of programming parameters used during the study for both devices. 670 T.R. Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® Standard procedures for trial and permanent implantations were used in the study. Dorsal root ganglion leads were placed in the lateral epidural space near the target DRG at levels from T10 to S2, depending on the dermatomal target corresponding to the subject’s primary region of pain. Spinal cord stimulation leads were placed in the medial or paramedial epidural space such that the caudal-most electrical contact was not caudal to the top of the L1 vertebral body on an anterior–posterior fluoroscopic view. Depending on the anatomical target, up to 16 contacts were placed for both study arms. Intraoperative testing to determine stimulation overlap with subjects’ painful areas was conducted during implantation. Figure 1 shows the lead placements for both groups. Table 3 summarizes the number and placement of leads for subjects in the study. 2.4. Sample size calculation and analysis populations Sample size was determined based on the planned noninferiority test for the composite safety and effectiveness primary end point of treatment success. Treatment success was defined as $50% reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) score in the primary area of pain during both trial and the 3-month visits with no incidence of stimulation-induced neurological deficits. Pilot data with 8 CRPS subjects and 22 causalgia subjects indicated that the success rate of DRG, defined as a 50% reduction in pain intensity, was 87% for CRPS subjects and 77% for causalgia subjects. Thus, an observed success rate at of least 15% above the 50% rate reported for SCS subjects was expected.14,28 Accounting for 15% attrition, an estimated 152 subjects (76 subjects in each arm) would provide greater than 85% power to test the primary end point hypothesis with a noninferiority margin of 10%. The primary, secondary, and tertiary effectiveness analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population including all randomized subjects who participated in the trial procedure (73 in each group). The MITT population was based on standard intention-to-treat principles, wherein subjects were analyzed based on their initial randomized treatments. The binary composite end points for success included subjects who failed the trial evaluation and exited the study as treatment failures. Table 1 Inclusion or exclusion criteria.

Data collection and general statistical methods Patient demographics and medical history were collected at baseline. At baseline and at each study visit, physical and neurological examinations, along with medication utilization, were recorded by study staff. Pain intensity was measured at baseline and at each study visit using the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain) where higher scores represent greater pain severity. At baseline and each study visit, assessments of quality of life, psychological disposition, and experiential factors (measures described in detail below)werecompleted.Alladverseevents(AEs)through12months were reported and the occurrence of any stimulation-related neurological deficits was documented. Descriptive statistics are presented as number of subjects, mean, SD, median, and range for all continuous variables and the number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables. As stipulated by the protocol and with the exception of the primary end point analysis, DRG stimulation and SCS were compared using a 2-sample t test (or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) for continuous outcomes and Pearson x2 test (or Fisher exact test) for categorical outcomes. Choice of parametric or alternative tests was based on the data distributions for each measure, and the test used is reported in the results. Two-sided confidence intervals are also provided for certain outcome measures of interest to assess differences between the treatment arm and the control arm. 2.6. Primary composite end point The predefined primary composite end point of the study was treatment success rates for the DRG subjects compared to the SCS subjects. To be considered a treatment success (1) a subject had a successful trial reporting $50% reduction in VAS score from baseline to the end of the trial phase, (2) reported a VAS Table 2 Programming settings. 3 mo 6 mo 9 mo 12 mo DRG SCS DRG SCS DRG SCS DRG SCS No. of subjects with available data 59 54 59 52 55 49 55 50 Frequency or rate range, Hz Mean (6SD) 20.8 (7.1) 65.5 (111.2) 20.0 (6.8) 63.6 (54.3) 19.0 (5.5) 72.0 (102.1) 19.0 (5.1) 63.6 (48.7) Min, max 10.0, 48.0 10.0, 1200.0 10.0, 48.0 10.0, 500.0 8.0, 40.0 15.0, 1000.0 10.0, 36.0 2.0, 3600.0 Pulse width, ms Mean (6SD) 306.4 (148.1) 408.2 (191.0) 315.4 (166.0) 432.5 (183.0) 295.6 (140.7) 432.6 (193.9) 289.8 (133.8) 417.1 (172.7) Min, max 30.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 90.0, 1000.0 90.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 90.0, 1000.0 60.0, 1000.0 Amplitude, mA Mean (6SD) 915.4 (822.0) 3288.8 (2255.2) 822.3 (724.0) 3590.4 (1912.6) 764.6 (630.9) 3304.1 (1848.8) 827.4 (657.1) 2929.7 (2024.3) Min, max 75.0, 6000.0 0.0, 9533.1 1.0, 4600.0 0.0, 10,076.3 100.0, 3950.0 0.0, 13,380.1 75.0, 4000.0 0.0, 12,659.8 DRG, dorsal root ganglion; SCS, spinal cord stimulation.

Figure 1. Lead placement. The lead for dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation is specialized to provide percutaneous entry through the epidural space, exiting through the foramen, and resting around the DRG. As shown in panel A, DRG leads were placed in the lateral epidural space near the target DRG. For the SCS arm (panel B), leads were placed in the medial or paramedial epidural space such that the caudal-most electrical contact was not caudal to the top of the L1 vertebral body on an anterior–posterior fluoroscopic view. Depending on the anatomical target, up to 16 contacts were placed for both study arms. Intraoperative testing to determine paresthesia overlap over pain areas was conducted during trial evaluation period. 672 T.R. Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® score at 3 months that was reduced from preimplant baseline by $50%, and (3) did not experience a stimulation-related neuro- logical deficit during either the trial phase or after permanent implant. A stimulation neurological deficit, different from AEs, was defined as a measurable 2-point worsening on the in-clinic sensory and motor neurological examination, within the appro- priate concordant anatomy, that was induced by stimulation and subsided in the absence of stimulation for at least 24 hours. Sensory and motor examinations were conducted by the physician and rated as 2 (normal function), 1 (decreased function), or 0 (abnormal function); a score of 0 would indicate neurological deficit. No neurological deficits, as defined, were recorded for any subjects in either arm of the study. In addition, if a subject withdrew from the study due to a device-, procedure-, or stimulation-related AE, the subject was treated as a failure in the primary end point analysis. As prespecified, the primary end point analyzed the success rate between the two treatment arms using Blackwelder methods for testing noninferiority between 2 proportions at a one-sided significance of 0.05.3 The noninferiority margin was set at 10%. If noninferiority of the primary end point was achieved, a superiority test was performed at a one-sided significance level of 0.025. 2.7. Secondary end point 2.7.1. Positional effects on paresthesia intensity Paresthesia intensity, a prespecified secondary end point, was assessed at 3 months. Paresthesia intensity was rated by subjects using a previously published paresthesia intensity rating scale.16 Subjects rated the intensity of their perception of paresthesia, while upright and supine, on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 representing “No feeling” to 10 “Very intense.” Perceived paresthesia intensity difference between supine and upright positions was calculated and averaged across each group This end point was evaluated at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 2.8. Other end points 2.8.1. Short-Form-36 The Short-Form-36 (SF-36) is a self-reported health-related quality-of-life scale with 36 questions that yield scores on 8 dimensions of quality of life including physical functioning, role- physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health.27,29 These 8 dimensions also are combined to provide 2 summary scales for physical health (Physical Component Summary) and mental health (Mental Component Summary). Improvements on the SF-36 scale are represented by increased scores. Within- and between-group improvements were examined using the calculated change from baseline for each subscale or summary scales. 2.8.2. Profile of mood states The profile of mood states (POMS) scale is a 65-item, 5-point Likert scale that measures mood states overall (total mood disturbance) as well as for 6 domains: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. Higher scores indicate more negative mood states except for the vigor domain where higher scores indicate increased vigor.6 Within- and between- group improvements were examined using the calculated change from baseline for each domain and the total POMS score. 2.8.3. Brief pain inventory The brief pain inventory (BPI) measures pain severity in the last 24 hours on a numeric pain rating scale from 0 “No pain” to 10 “Pain as bad as you can imagine,” and interference due to pain from 0 “Does not interfere” to 10 “Completely interferes.”5 The interference score was calculated as the mean of the interference items, and 2 subscales for the activity dimension and the affective dimensions of interference were tabulated. Within- and between- group improvements were examined using the calculated change from baseline for the pain and interference scales and for each interference subscale. 2.8.4. Subject satisfaction Subjects completed a satisfaction scale at the end of trial phase and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Subjects rated satisfaction with pain relief and the therapy in general on an 11-point numeric rating scale with 0 indicating “Not Satisfied” and 10 indicating “Very Satisfied.” Subjects rated the likelihood of undergoing the therapy again on an 11-point numeric rating scale with 0 indicating “Not Likely” and 10 indicating “Very Likely.” Finally subjects rated the their subjective change in pain since baseline on a 7 point scale ranging from “Much Worse” to “Much Better.” Ratings were treated as interval data and summarized with descriptive statistics of central tendency. 2.8.5. Stimulation specificity Stimulation specificity was evaluated to determine the extent to which paresthesia was felt by subjects in anatomical regions that were not painful at baseline. The pain and paresthesia diagram forms had identical diagrams of the human body on which subjects marked where they felt pain and paresthesia. The baseline pain diagrams completed by the subjects were compared to the subjects’ paresthesia maps completed at the end of trial phase and at 3 months postimplant. Subjects were categorized based on the presence or absence of one or more paresthesia areas at follow-up that were not coincident with a pain area at baseline. 2.8.6. Percentage change in visual analog scale The percentage of change in VAS score from baseline to each scheduled follow-up was computed for each subject and inspected using descriptive statistics and confidence intervals. Missing data were not imputed for this analysis; only subjects with VAS scores at baseline and follow-up were included in the analysis. 2.9. Safety analysis Adverse events were collected and tabulated at all scheduled or unscheduled visits during the study. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom or disease temporarily associated with the use of the implanted device, whether or not related to the device. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any AE that is immediately life threatening; results in significant, persistent, or permanent disability; neces- sitates invasive intervention to prevent permanent impairment or death; results in the need for a 24-hour hospital stay or prolongation of a hospital stay; or results in death. Adverse event and SAE rates are expressed as the number of patients divided by the population at risk for each group (n 5 76) through the 12-month study visit. All AEs reported were reviewed by an April 2017·Volume 158·Number 4 www.painjournalonline.com 673 independent event committee that coded and adjudicated each event with regard to seriousness and relatedness to the implant procedure, device, and/or stimulation therapy. 3. Results 3.1. Patient accounting See CONSORT diagram for full accounting (Fig. 2). Briefly, 320 subjects were consented and enrolled in the study from 22 investigational sites. Of these subjects, 168 were excluded for screen failures because they failed to meet the study’s inclusion or exclusion criteria with the majority failing to meet the diagnostic criteria for inclusion. The remaining 152 subjects were enrolled and randomized to either the DRG or the SCS arm (76 in each arm). After randomization, 3 subjects from each group did not continue to the trial evaluation phase. Subjects who failed the success criterion at the end of the trial phase were exited from the study and considered treatment failures for composite end point analyses. A total of 61 DRG subjects and 54 SCS subjects met the success criteria at the end of their trial phase and continued to permanent implant. By the 12-month visit, 55 DRG subjects and 50 SCS subjects had evaluable data. On average, each active study site randomized 3 subjects (range 0, 9) to each arm of the study. At any one site, the maximum number of randomized subjects was 11% (17/152) of the MITT population. 3.2. Baseline characteristics The average age of subjects was 52.4 years in the DRG stimulation arm and 52.5 years in the SCS arm. There were slightly more females than males in both arms (51.3% for both arms). Race was predominantly white (94.7% and 92.1% for DRG and SCS, respectively). Average body mass index was 30.5 for DRG and 28.9 for SCS. The average duration of chronic lower limb pain was 7.5 years for the DRG arm and 6.8 years for the SCS arm. Comorbidities and medications taken for subject conditions were similar in both arms. Overall, no statistically significant differences were found among the baseline characteristics between treatment arms.SeeTable4fora detailedsummaryofbaseline characteristics. Similar distribution of CRPS (DRG: 44/76 [57.9%]; SCS: 43/76 [56.6%]) and causalgia (DRG: 32/76 [42.1%]; SCS: 33/76 [43.4%]) was reported between the arms. All CRPS subjects had sensory symptoms, 82/87 (94.3%) had motor trophic symptoms, 57/87 (65.5%) had vasomotor symptoms, and 58/87 (66.7%) had sudomotor or edema symptoms. A total of 79 of the 87 CRPS subjects had at least one symptom in each of 3 symptom categories documented at baseline; 8 CRPS subjects (3 in the DRG group and 5 in the SCS group) had one symptom ineachof 2symptomcategories documented at the time of the baseline evaluation (sensory and motor).

For subjects diagnosed with causalgia the injured nerves are documented in Table 5. 3.3. Primary composite end point Figure 3 summarizes the primary composite end point results at 3 months, when the primary end point was ascertained, as well as over time through 12 months. No neurological deficits were reported during the study, so the rates of success at each time point include those subjects with a permanent implant who reported at least a 50% reduction in VAS from preimplant levels. Randomized subjects who did not proceed to permanent implant were considered treatment failures for this end point at each study visit. The proportion of subjects who achieved treatment success at 3 months in the DRG arm (81.2%; 56/69) was statistically greater than the SCS arm (55.7%; 39/70). The results demonstrated that DRG stimulation met not only noninferiority (P , 0.0001) but also statistical superiority (P , 0.0004). Long term, the proportion of subjects who achievedtreatmentsuccess at 12 monthsin theDRG arm (74.2%; 49/66) also was greater than that in the SCS arm (53.0%; 35/66); theseresults demonstrated both noninferiority (P , 0.0001) and superiority (P , 0.0004) at the long-term follow-up. Similar results were observed at 3 months when the primary end point was stratified by primary diagnoses. For CRPS, a greater proportion of DRG subjects (82.5%) met the primary end point at 3 months than SCS subjects (57.5%) (noninferiority, P , 0.001; superiority, P 5 0.006). For causalgia, the proportion of subjects who met the primary end point was higher for DRG (79.3%) than for SCS (53.3%) (noninferiority, P 5 0.001; superiority, P 5 0.014). 3.4. Secondary end point On average, DRG subjects experienced significantly less postural variation in perceived paresthesia intensity than the SCS subjects (P , 0.001) at 3 months. Dorsal root ganglion subjects reported a mean difference between supine and upright paresthesia intensity rating of 20.1 6 1.6, and SCS subjects had a mean difference of 1.8 6 3.0. These results persisted throughout the study (Fig. 4). 3.5. Other end points 3.5.1. Short-Form-36 Table 6 summarizes the SF-36 results. Both the DRG stimulation and SCS groups experienced improvements in SF-36 scores from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05) and 12 months, with the one exception that the General Health scale was not significantly improved at 12 months in the SCS group (P . 0.05). At 3 months, the change in the mental health dimension was statistically better for DRG stimulation subjects compared to SCS subjects (P 5 0.0295). At12 months, DRG subjects had statistically greater improvement on 3 scales: overall change in the physical component score (P 5 0.04), general health (P 5 0.03), and social functioning (P 5 0.03) when compared to SCS subjects. 3.5.2. Profile of mood states Both groups experienced improvements in all domains of the POMS from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05).

Figure 5 presents the change in POMS scores through the 12-month visit. The changes in POMS scores from baseline to 3 months were statistically greater for DRG subjects than for SCS subjects for the Total Mood Disturbance scale (P 5 0.0466) and the tension domain (P 5 0.0430). Specifically, the Total Mood Disturbance at 3 months improved by a magnitude of 20.4 points (29.0 at baseline to 8.6 at 3 months) for DRG subjects, and only a magnitude of 14.7 points (25.6 at baseline to 10.9 at 3 months) for SCS subjects. These improvements in the Total Mood Disturbance and tension domain score for DRG subjects persisted to 12 months (P 5 0.021 and P 5 0.004, respectively). In addition, at 12 months, the depression (P 5 0.004) and confusion (P 5 0.020) domains also demonstrated statistically greater magnitudes of improvement for DRG subjects compared to the improvements for SCS subjects. 3.5.3. Brief pain inventory As shown in Table 7, both groups experienced improvements in all of the BPI scales from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05) and 12 months (P , 0.05). Between the 2 groups, improvements from baseline on the interference scale (treatment 4.2, control 3.0), the activity scale (treatment 4.5, control 3.4), and the affective scale (treatment 3.8, control 2.5) were statistically greater (P , 0.05) for DRG subjects compared to SCS subjects at 3 months. These results persisted to 12 months. 3.5.4. Subject satisfaction The majority of patients in both groups reported high degrees of satisfaction (Table 8) for all 4 satisfaction items. However, no statistical significance was found between the groups for all items assessed (P . 0.05). 3.5.5. Stimulation specificity At 3 months, SCS subjects were 2.3 times more likely to report feeling paresthesia in one or more nonpainful areas as DRG subjects (35.2% vs 15.3%, P 5 0.0142). At 12 months postim- plant, SCS subjects were 7.1 times more likely to report feeling paresthesia in one or more nonpainful areas as DRG subjects (38.8% vs 5.5%, P , 0001). The percent of subjects who reported that they felt paresthesia in only their painful region(s) at 3 and 12 months was 84.7% and 94.5% in the DRG group, and 64.8% and 61.2% in the SCS group. 3.5.6. Percentage change in visual analog scale As shown in Table 9, DRG stimulation demonstrated a greater mean percent reduction in VAS scores than SCS (84.1% vs 70.9%, respectively) with the significant reduction persisting to 6 months and 12 months. Subjects using DRG reported mean VAS of 80.6 mm at baseline, which reduced to 13.1 mm at 3 months and remained low, at 15.0 mm, at 12 months. The subjects using SCS reported a baseline mean VAS of 80.7, 3-month mean VAS of 23.8 mm, and 12-month mean VAS of 26.5 mm. 3.6. Safety analysis A total of 21 SAEs occurred in 19 subjects (8 DRG subjects and 11 SCS subjects). The rates of SAEs were 10.5% (8/76) in the DRG arm and 14.5% (11/76) in the SCS arm. The difference in the rate of SAEs between groups was not statistically different (P 5 0.62). Two of the SAEs in the control group were adjudicated as definitely related to the implant procedure. Both events were infections that required device explant. There were no unanticipated SAEs or stimulation-induced neurological deficits at any time during the study. None of the subjects died. Table 10 presents the rates of related AEs. Fifty two procedure-related events were reported by 35 patients (46.1%) in the DRG arm, and 29 procedure-related events were reported by 20 patients (26.3%) in the SCS arm, yielding a statistically significant difference between the groups (P 5 0.018).

Subjects who exited the study after randomization were considered treatment failures. At all study visits, the proportion of subjects in the DRG stimulation group with successful therapy was noninferior to SCS (Blackwelder test of 2 proportions, all P , 0.01).

Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® contributors to the differential rate of procedure-related AEs are the procedure times and number of leads. Procedure times for permanent implant averaged 107.2 minutes (651.2) for DRG subjects and 75.7 minutes (632.2) for SCS subjects. In addition, 16.4% (10/61) of DRG subjects were implanted with 3 or 4 leads, while all SCS subjects had 1 or 2 leads implanted. For both groups, the most frequently occurring procedure-related AE was pain at the incision sites with 7 events reported by 6 patients (7.9%) in the DRG arm and 5 events reported by 5 patients (6.6%) in the SCS arm. For device-related AEs, 39 events were reported by 28 patients (36.8%) in the DRG arm and 24 events were reported by 20 patients (26.3%) in the SCS arm. No statistical difference was found between the groups (P 5 0.22). The most frequently occurring device-related AE in the DRG arm was implantable pulse generator (IPG) pocket pain with 10 events reported by 10 patients (13.2%). On the other hand, the most frequently occurring device- related AE in the SCS arm was loss of stimulation due to lead migration with 8 events reported by 8 (10.5%) patients. There was also no statistical difference between the groups for stimulation-related AEs (P 5 0.8025). Ten events were reported by 8 patients (10.5%) in the DRG arm, and 10 events were reported by 10 patients (13.2%) in the SCS arm. The most frequently occurring stimulation-related AE for both groups was overstimulation with 3 events reported by 3 patients (3.9%) in the DRG arm and 5 events reported by 5 patients (6.6%) in the SCS arm.

Discussion This study represents the largest randomized controlled trial assessing DRG stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable painassociatedwiththe diagnosesof CRPSorcausalgia.Analysis of the primary end point revealed that subjects using DRG stimulation had a higher rate of treatment success (81.2%) compared with the treatment success rate for traditional SCS (56.7%). Furthermore, pain relief persisted through 12 months of follow-up and remained significantly lower for DRG subjects than for those using SCS. Subjects using DRG reported significantly less postural-related changes in paresthesia and showed larger improvements on measures of quality of life, functional status, and psychological disposition than subjects using SCS. The safety profile of the DRG stimulation device was similar to traditional SCS devices, with the exception of the rate of procedural events. These results for DRG stimulation as a treatment of chronic neuropathic pain associated with CRPS and causalgia must be interpreted within the context of previous neurostimulation studies for this population. Treatment of chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy with SCS,in combination with physical therapy, reduced pain to a greater degree than physical therapy alone14; mean VAS scores for implanted patients reduced to 3.5 cm on a 10-cm VAS scale after 6 months of SCS. A retrospective analysis of SCS for the treatment of CRPS reported a mean VAS of 5.6 cm over a mean follow-up time of 88 months.19 Mean VAS scores during SCS therapy in both these previous studies were higher, by a clinically meaningful margin10 than the VAS score of 13.1 mm and 15 mm reported by subjects treated with DRG stimulation in our study at 3 and 12 months. Similarly, Geurts et al.11 reported only a 50% pain reduction in an observational trial of SCS for CRPS. Figure 5. Change in profile of mood states (POMS) at 12 months.

Deer et al.·158 (2017) 669–681 PAIN® A study using a heterogeneous population, including subjects with CRPS, reported that 68.4% of subjects were able to achieve $50% leg pain relief, and 60% of subjects achieved $50% pain relief for overall pain.21 A published case series of CRPS subjects reported that 71.4% of subjects achieved $50% pain relief after 6 months of DRG stimula- tion.28 In addition, a randomized trial comparing SCS to physical therapy for subjects with CRPS reported that 50% of subjects achieved at least 50% reduction in pain intensity.14 Here, we report an 84% reduction in pain for patients treated with DRG stimulation and that 81% of subjects achieved $50% pain relief. Furthermore, the optimal programming for DRG stimulation is still being developed; Table 2 shows that SCS and DRG parameters were quite different. Additional developments in optimized programming for DRG should improve clinical outcomes over time for this therapy. Taken together, we conclude that DRG stimulation provides better pain relief than traditional SCS. Patients with CRPS and causalgia are difficult to treat with symptoms for 20% to 80% of CRPS I patients persisting for 1 year, even when treatment was considered successful.2 Surgical interventions such as joint denervation or neurolysis also have variable outcomes; approximately 20% of patients failed to report low pain intensity and improved activities of daily living 2 years after surgery.9 For patients with CRPS I or causalgia who do not achieve adequate pain management with conservative therapies, SCS provides an additional and reversible treatment option.

April 2017·Volume 158·Number 4 www.painjournalonline.com 679 providing a therapy that is adaptable to each patient’s individual pain profile through more precise anatomical targeting. The pathways for sensory afferents into the central nervous system via the DRG are well documented.4,13 Anatomically, peripheral inputs associated with pain symptoms can be traced to relevant DRG at one or more spinal levels. Stimulation of the relevant DRG modifies pain signaling from the periphery for only the affected dermatomes. By contrast, SCS targets large dermatomal areas through stimulation of the dorsal column at anatomically defined spinal levels, and, as such, modifies ascending pathways for pain while also modulating collateral afferents in or near the medial lemniscus. Modulating pain signals from distal appendages with SCS typically requires that multiple dermatomes be captured–with paresthesias in the entire region. Our results showed that subjects treated with DRG stimulation had significantly less perceived stimulation sensation in nonpainful areas than subjects using SCS, while reporting better pain relief. This may indicate more precision targeting by virtue of the greater anatomical specificity with DRG stimulation. The differences in collateral paresthesia may also be influenced by differences in programming parameters. Programming param- eters were individualized for each subject’s optimal experience. The resulting parameters were quite different between the 2 therapies (Table 2) with much lower amplitudes for DRG programming. This was expected from pilot work7 and because diffusion of energy by the cerebrospinal fluid is less influential at the DRG. The between-subjects design of this study prohibits a real comparison of the relationship between targeting, programming, and pain relief; more research is needed. Chronic pain conditions, in general, are associated with disturbances in mood and physical and social functioning.1,22,24 The targeted pain relief provided by DRG stimulation in the ACCURATE study was also associated with additional benefits. After 3 months, subjects using DRG stimulation reported significantly greater improvements in total mood disturbance, as measured by the POMS, as well as larger improvements pain interference, affective disruption, and activity, as measured by the BPI. Moreover, by 12 months, subjects treated with DRG stimulation reported significantly larger improvements than SCS subjects for physical function, general health, and social function, as measured by the SF-36. Despite the differences reported for treatment success, pain relief, and affective or functional outcomes, the majority of subjects were satisfied with their respective therapy, regardless of treatment group. While subjects using DRG stimulation reported a larger magnitude of change and there was a greater proportion of successfulsubjectswithDRGstimulation,SCSsubjects,asagroup, did report significant improvements from baseline in all measured domains. The satisfaction results reported here reflect the improve- ments from preimplant baseline experienced by subjects. The rate of AEs for DRG stimulation, through 12 months postimplant, was similar to that seen for the SCS-treated subjects in this study and in previous reports.17,20 Only 2 subjects had procedure-related SAEs; 2 infections in the SCS group that required explant. It is notable that the rate of nonserious procedure-related events was higher for the DRG stimulation group (46%) compared with the SCS group (26%). The higher rate of procedure-related events may be attributed to the differences in average procedure time and a greater number of leads placed for DRG some subjects, which may increase exposure to risk. It is expected that additional experience with DRG implantation will result in shorter procedure times and fewer procedure-related events. There are limitations to this study that may affect the interpretation of the results. The calculated success rate was contingent upon subjects not only achieving 50% pain relief but also continuing in the study (dropouts were counted as failures). Therefore, the success rate could be influenced by factors associated with the lack of blinded treatments (eg, SCS subjects were less motivated to stay in the trial, uncontrolled differences in health care provider interactions). In addition, subjects were required to maintain a stable regimen of pain medications through 3 months only, and the long-term results after 3 months may be affected by medication changes. The SCS device also had limitations placed on the programming of the device so that the comparison between the devices was not confounded by unique SCS device programming features. In particular, the accelerom- eter function in the SCS device was disabled. If the accelerometer was enabled, the SCS group may have had less postural changes in perceived paresthesia intensity. In addition, the analysis of subjects who did and did not experience paresthesia when stimulation was on was confounded by the fact that the SCS device instruction for use requires the device to be programmed for subjects to receive paresthesia. In addition, the number of subjects who did not have paresthesia is very small, and this end point was not adequately powered to detect the difference in pain relief for subjects who reported feeling vs not feeling paresthesia. In conclusion, CRPS I and causalgia, in their chronic forms, are difficult to treat with variable outcomes with conservative symptom management. Neuromodulation techniques, like SCS, may benefit many patients who have exhausted other therapy options. SCS, however, often has a limited ability to target discrete focal anatomical regions of pain, as is common in CRPS and causalgia. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation provides an effective alternative that provides precision stimulation targeting and improved patient outcomes.

Slavin1*, Richard B. North2, Timothy R. Deer3, Peter Staats4, Kristina Davis5 and Roni Diaz5 Abstract Background: Burst stimulation is a novel form of neurostimulation for the treatment of chronic pain which has demonstrated promise in small uncontrolled studies, but has not yet gained approval for use in the U.S. We report the study methods for an ongoing multicenter, randomized, controlled, cross-over study designed to gain United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for burst stimulation. Methods: Participants who are candidates for a currently approved neurostimulation device were enrolled and screened. Participants who fail a tonic trial evaluation, have significant depressive symptoms, or evidence lack of compliance with study procedures by failing to complete 7 days of a Pain Diary are excluded. Participants receiving a permanent implant are randomized to receive: (1) 12 weeks of tonic followed by 12 weeks of burst stimulation or (2) 12 weeks of burst stimulation followed by 12 weeks of tonic stimulation. Assessments occur at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, participants choose their preferred therapy and are assessed every 6 months for up to 2 years. All patients had the device leads inserted at the site of a successful tonic stimulation trial. Assessments include: a Pain Diary using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for overall, trunk, and limb pain, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Oswestry Disability Index, paresthesia, satisfaction, and therapy preference. Reported adverse events are collected throughout the study. The primary endpoint is the noninferiority of burst stimulation compared to tonic measured by the within-subject difference in the mean overall VAS score at the end of each 12-week stimulation period. Discussion: This trial represents the largest controlled trial of burst stimulation to date, and is expected to yield important information regarding the safety and efficacy of burst stimulation.

Trials  (2016) 17:569  DOI 10.1186/s13063-016-1706-5 Background Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established therapy to treat chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and limbs [1]. Traditional SCS produces tonic waveforms in which pulses are delivered at a consistent frequency, pulse width, and amplitude. New technological developments using alternate waveforms to stimulate the dorsal column and/ or aim at new stimulation targets show promising results [2]. Burst stimulation, in particular, is a waveform that delivers groups of pulses at a high frequency and at amplitudes much lower than tonic stimulation; these groups of pulses are separated by a pulse-free period called an interburst interval during which passive re- polarization occurs prior to the next burst. This pat- tern was chosen because this burst waveform mimics naturally occurring neuronal firing in the central nervous system [3]. The use of the burst waveform in SCS for the treat- ment of chronic pain was first reported in 2010 [4]. Since that time, reports from multiple, relatively small, clinical studies have shown that burst stimulation pro- vides effective pain control, which, in some patients, may surpass the pain relief provided by tonic stimulation [5–8]. In these studies, the additional pain reduction during burst stimulation was relatively only marginally smaller compared with tonic stimulation results, but burst stimulation was preferred by a majority of patients in spite of the similar pain-reducing profile. Some evidence indicates that burst stimulation may provide a salvage therapy option for patients who fail to achieve adequate pain control with tonic stimulation or for those in whom the initial efficacy of tonic stimulation is lost over time [7, 8]. A common element in all previous clinical studies is the marked reduction or total absence of paresthesia during burst stimulation. Tonic stimulation is predicated on the use of paresthesiae to “cover” painful areas, and little evidence has been reported for efficacious therapy when tonic stimulation is delivered at subperception levels. Alternatively, burst stimulation appears to pro- duce paresthesia in only a subset of patients, approxi- mately 17–25% [4, 7, 8], and anecdotal reports indicate that paresthesiae during burst stimulation may be quali- tatively different from those experienced during tonic stimulation. Perceptual difference in the patient experi- ence may exert an indirect influence on patient-reported outcomes. To date, the mechanisms and clinical effects of the burst waveform have been mainly studied in small co- horts of patients in Europe and Australia over a short duration (e.g., 2–4 weeks). Larger, longer-term, con- trolled clinical studies of the burst waveform are lacking. Burst stimulation has not yet been approved for use in the U.S. Here, we report the study methods for an ongoing multicenter, cross-over, randomized controlled study designed to gain United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for burst stimulation (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02011893). Methods Objectives Under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), the objective of the study (protocol C-12-07 ver 8.28.14) is to demonstrate safety and efficacy for burst stimulation. As such, the study examines burst stimulation compared to the traditional SCS stimulation mode (tonic stimula- tion). The primary objective of the study is to establish noninferiority of pain intensity after 3 months of burst compared to 3 months of tonic stimulation. Previous studies [5–8] indicated that burst stimulation was pre- ferred by most subjects even when the magnitude of pain relief was similar. Therefore, the primary objective of noninferiority of pain intensity will establish the ther- apy as comparable for pain relief to traditional tonic stimulation, and secondary objectives (listed below) will examine the superiority of pain relief and other out- comes that may elucidate the patient experience of burst stimulation. Secondary objectives are: � To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation in responder rate � To demonstrate significant differences in the presence of paresthesia during tonic stimulation and burst stimulation � To demonstrate that pain relief using burst stimulation is superior to pain relief using tonic stimulation � To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation adverse events � To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation for quality of life � To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation for worst pain � To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation for function Additional analyses will examine these objectives after 12 months of therapy. Trial design The study consists of two distinct phases: (1) a 24-week controlled (cross-over) phase during which participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment se- quences of tonic and burst stimulation, each for 12 weeks and (2) an open-label phase during which participants may use either waveform (see Figs. 1 and 2). With guidance from the FDA, the study employs Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 2 of 11 enrichment strategies aimed at decreasing variability and assessing the efficacy of burst compared to an approved SCS waveform. As such, participants are limited to those who achieve adequate pain relief during a traditional tonic stimulation trial evaluation; all participants use both waveforms in a within-subject cross-over design. At up to 20 centers in the U.S., Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is obtained (refer to its “Declara- tions” page), and eligible enrolled participants undergo additional screening and participate in a standard SCS trial evaluation using tonic stimulation. Those with a successful SCS trial evaluation are implanted with the Prodigy™ neurostimulation system (St. Jude Medical, Fig. 1 Study design. Schematic of the study design and follow-up schedule Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 3 of 11 Plano, TX, USA) that can deliver both burst and tonic waveforms. Lead position for the permanent system is determined by placement for optimum paresthesia cover- age during the tonic stimulation trial evaluation. After a 2–3 week surgical recovery period, participants with the permanent system are randomized to receive one of the two treatment sequences over the subsequent 24 weeks. During the control phase, participants use one wave- form for 12 weeks then cross over to the other waveform for the remaining 12 weeks. Participants are randomly assigned (1:1) at each study site using computer-generated assignment to receive 12 weeks of tonic stimulation followed by 12 weeks of burst stimulation, or 12 weeks of burst stimulation followed by 12 weeks of tonic stimula- tion. Participants in both groups complete assessments at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks after randomization. To enhance participant compliance with the study protocol, a washout period was not employed when par- ticipants crossed over. This decision was based on previ- ous reports suggesting that 25–80% of patients may fail to comply with the study protocol when asked to undergo periods without stimulation [9, 10]. Assessments occur at a minimum of 6 weeks after changing stimulation modes, which is adequate time to ensure that any after-effects of the previous therapy will not influence the assessment of the current therapy [11, 12]. During the open-label phase of the study, participants attend study visits for assessment every 6 months for up to 2 years post randomization. Perceptible differences in paresthesia between the two waveforms are likely, thus neither patients nor investigators are blinded to treat- ment sequence. Fig. 2 Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) figure Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 4 of 11 Any changes to the protocol will be reported to the IRB for each site and to the FDA. The protocol, and this reported version of the protocol conform to the Stand- ard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines; a copy of the SPIRIT Check- list accompanies this report as part of the supplemental materials (see Additional file 1). Participants Participants with chronic neuropathic pain of the trunk and/or limbs are invited to consider study participation. After signing an informed consent, enrolled participants are evaluated for compliance with the inclusion/exclu- sion criteria (see Table 1). Participants who fail to com- ply with the Pain Diary assessment (see “Assessments” section) are excluded from the study. Participants who evidence moderate-to-severe depression and/or suicidal ideation, measured by the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), do not meet the criteria and are excluded from the study. This was derived, with guidance from the FDA, to select participants who were free from serious affective comorbidities requiring behavioral/pharmaco- logical interventions in addition to pain therapy. Partici- pants were prohibited from increasing the dosage of pain medications, with the exception of acetaminophen, during the first 24 weeks of the study. Participants were not required to stop or decrease pain medications at any time during the study. Interventions The SCS trial evaluation period, per usual care (approximately 3 to 10 days), is performed with epidural leads placed percutaneously under local anesthesia and connected to an external pulse generator that delivers tonic stimulation (St. Jude Medical, Plano, TX, USA). The implanted SCS device, Prodigy™ (St. Jude Medical, Plano, TX, USA), a constant current generator, is capable of delivering both tonic and burst waveforms. Surgical implant of the permanent system occurs approximately 4 to 8 weeks after the end of the trial evaluation period, pursuant to usual care and surgical scheduling. After the permanent implant, a surgical recovery period of 2 to 3 weeks occurs to allow for wound healing during which transient medication increases were allowed. Tonic stimulation pulse width is programmed in the usual range of 100–500 μs, and tonic stimulation frequencies are set at between 30 Hz and 100 Hz. Amplitudes for tonic stimulation are programmed according to individual partici- pant perception to a level that typically produces comfort- able paresthesia. Burst programming for this study (see Fig. 3) followed specific parameters such that 500-Hz stimu- lation is delivered in groups of five pulses with 1-ms pulse width, with bursts repeated 40 times per second. Charge balance occurs during the 5 ms after each burst with passive repolarization. Amplitudes for burst stimulation are pro- grammed according to individual participant perception. During the control phase of the study, participants are advised that they might or might not experience paresthesia at the outset of both waveforms. Assessment tools See Fig. 2 and Table 2 for a schedule of assessments. Pain history and participant demographics Upon enrollment, participants answer relevant questions pertaining to pain history, previous treatment history, and participant demographic information (including height, weight, age, race, and marital status). Pain A daily Pain Diary is completed for the 7-day period prior to each study visit. In the diary, participants are asked to rate pain intensity using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which consists of a horizontal line 100 mm Table 1 Inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria • Ability to provide informed consent • Aged 22 years or older • Chronic intractable neuropathic pain of the trunk and/or limbs • Baseline average daily overall pain score of ≥60 on the Visual Analog Scale collected with the 7-day Pain Diary • Failed ≥3 documented medically supervised treatments (including, but not limited to, physical therapy, acupuncture, etc.) as well as treatment with ≥2 classes of medication • Stable pain-related medication regimen 4 weeks prior to the screening evaluation • Deemed a good candidate for SCS by the investigator • Deemed a suitable study candidate by a psychologist or psychiatrist • Agrees not to add to or increase pain medication during the study • Willing to cooperate with the study requirements, including compliance with the regimen and completion of all office visits • Female candidates of child-bearing potential agree to commit to the use of an effective method of contraception for the duration of the study Exclusion criteria • Current participation in a clinical trial with an active treatment arm • History of a neurostimulation trial or implanted system • Presence of an infusion pump or any implantable neurostimulator • Overall Beck Depression Inventory II score is >24 or, at the screening visit, a score of 3 on Question 9 relating to suicidal thoughts or wishes • Receiving, applying for, or considering workers’ compensation or involved in disability litigation • Concurrent clinically significant or disabling chronic pain problem that requires additional treatment • Existing medical condition that is likely to require repetitive MRI evaluation • Existing medical condition that is likely to require the use of diathermy • History of cancer requiring active treatment in the past 6 months • Pain originating from peripheral vascular disease • Participant is immunocompromised • Documented history of allergic response to titanium or silicone • Documented history of substance (narcotics, alcohol, etc.) abuse or dependency in the 6 months prior to baseline • Pregnancy (confirmed by positive urine/blood test) MRI magnetic resonance imaging, SCS spinal cord stimulation Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 5 of 11 in length, anchored by word descriptors on each end (no pain to worst imaginable pain). Higher scores indicate higher pain levels. Each diary entry includes four differ- ent VAS scores to permit calculation of a weekly average for daily overall pain, worst overall pain, trunk pain, and limb pain. Participants arriving at the baseline visit with less than seven diary entries repeat the baseline diary. If repeating the baseline diary results in less than seven entries, the participant is deemed a screening failure. Participants complete the baseline pain diaries without making changes to their current, stable pain medica- tions. After randomization, missing diary entries are accommodated during data analysis (see “Statistical methods” section for more details). Participants also complete the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire version 2 (SF-MPQ-2), a validated questionnaire that measures the qualities of pain [13]. The SF-MPQ-2 is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 22 different pain descriptors. The par- ticipant indicates the intensity of each pain descriptor as it pertains to the participant’s pain experience. Intensity ratings for each descriptor are provided on a scale ranging from 0 (“none”) to 10 (“worst possible”). The total SF-MPQ-2 score is the sum of the score of three sensory subscales (continuous, intermittent, and predominantly neuropathic pain descriptors) and one affective subscale. Higher scores indicate a higher severity of symptoms. Medication Throughout the study, site study personnel complete a medication log to track the participants’ reported daily doses and names of pain medications (prescription and over-the-counter) and medications known to affect pain perception (e.g., certain antidepressants). Quality of life The SF-36v2™ Health Survey [14] is a validated, self- administered short-form health questionnaire with 36 questions. Scoring produces eight subscale scores for vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. These eight subscales are used to calculate two summary component scores for physical and mental health. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life. Pain catastrophizing The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a validated scale to assess the quality of thoughts and feelings during pain [15]. The PCS includes 13 statements for which partici- pants rate the frequency with which the statement matches their pain experience, from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“always”). The scale is self-administered, takes 5 min to complete, and examines three domains: rumination, magnification, and helplessness. A higher score indicates a higher level of catastrophizing. Disability The Oswestry Disability Index 2.1a (ODI) is a validated low-back pain questionnaire that indicates the extent to which a person’s functional level is restricted by disability [16]. The self-administered questionnaire includes 10 questions and takes approximately 5 min to complete. The questionnaire produces a percentage total score that Fig. 3 Waveforms. Tonic stimulation provides a consistent stream of pulses at a set frequency, pulse width, and amplitude. Burst stimulation delivers groups of pulses at a lower amplitude and a higher frequency than tonic stimulation. Bursts of pulses are followed by pulse-free periods during which charge balance occurs Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 6 of 11 indicates the degree of disability; a higher percentage indi- cates a greater disability. Mood The Beck Depression Inventory BDI-II is a 21-question validated assessment that evaluates the intensity of depressive symptoms [17]. The questionnaire takes approximately 5 min to complete. The total score is categorized by minimal, mild, moderate, and severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Pain and paresthesia mapping Pain location is documented on a map of the body labeled with different numbered segments. The participant is instructed to shade-in or place an “X” in the area(s) of pain. Paresthesia mapping is documented using a body map similar to that used for pain location mapping. The par- ticipant is instructed to shade-in or place an “X” in the area(s) for which they experience paresthesia or other perceptible stimulation sensations. Participants are also asked to indicate the area or areas on the body map for which pain relief translates to the greatest improvement for their daily activities. Patient Global Impression of Change At the 12-and 24-week visits and at all long-term follow-up visits, participants are asked to complete a standard seven-item Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Likert scale, ranging from “no change” to “a great deal better.” Therapy preference and satisfaction After using both therapy types (at 24 weeks), partici- pants are asked to indicate which waveform they prefer and to provide a reason for their preference. At each follow-up, participants are asked to rate satis- faction with the device by selecting from the following options on a 5-point Likert scale: very satisfied, satis- fied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied. Adverse events Adverse events (AEs) are recorded for enrolled partici- pants at any visit, including unscheduled visits. AEs are classified according to their relationship to the device(s) and/or procedures and according to severity. All AEs, regardless of the reason or severity, are followed with appropriate corrective actions by the investigators until a satisfactory resolution is obtained. Study visits Table 2 shows the assessments scheduled for each study visit. At the enrollment visit, participants adhering to the initial inclusion/exclusion criteria sign informed consent, complete assessments, and start the VAS Pain Diary. If required of female participants, a pregnancy test is per- formed. Participants who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria after initial assessments and completion of the base- line Pain Diary complete additional assessments and are scheduled for the tonic stimulation trial evaluation period for 3–7 days. Participants with a successful trial, defined as a patient-reported pain reduction of at least 50%, proceed to a permanent implant. After a surgical recovery period of 2–3 weeks, participants are randomized (1:1 at each site) using an online electronic program provided by St. Jude Table 2 Study visits and associated assessments Visit Assessments Enrollment and screening • Pain history and demographics • BDI-II • Pain Location Form • Medications • Provide subject with the 7-day Pain Diary for the baseline evaluation Baseline evaluation • 7-day Pain Diary returned • SF-MPQ-2 • ODI2.1a • SF-36v2TM • PCS • Medications Trial system implantation • 7-day Pain Diary returned • Medications End of trial visit (4–8 days after trial system implantation) • Medications • End-of-trial physician assessment System implantation • Medications • Physician’s record surgical summary for the procedure, including any complications Randomization/activation • Medications • Participant programming record Control phase follow-up visits (Occurring at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks after randomization) • 7-day Pain Diary returned • SF-MPQ-2 • ODI2.1a • SF-36v2TM • PCS • Medications • Paresthesia mapping • Self-evaluation End of control phase (Assessments occurring at the 24-week visit, in addition to those described above) • PGIC • Patient preference Open-label phase follow-up visits (Occurring every 6 months for up to 2 years) • 7-day Pain Diary returned • SF-MPQ-2 • ODI2.1a • SF-36v2TM • PCS • Medications • Paresthesia mapping • Self-evaluation BDI-II Beck Depression Inventory BDI-II, OD12.1a Oswestry Disability Index 2.1a, PCS Pain Catastrophizing Scale, PGIC Patient Global Impression of Change, SF- 36v2TM Short-form 36 Health Survey, SF-MPQ-2 Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire version 2 Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 7 of 11 Medical and the prescribed programming is activated. All participants receive a patient programmer that enables acti- vation of the ON and OFF positions and adjustments to amplitude within the prescribed range. During the control phase of the study, participants at- tend follow-up visits at the mid-point and end of each of the two 12-week phases of treatment. At the 12-week visit, participants cross over to the second stimulation mode of their treatment sequence and continue in the study for an additional 12 weeks (through 24 weeks). Participants are programmed to their preferred stimu- lation mode at the end of the 24-week visit. Subse- quently, participants attend follow-up visits every 6 months for up to 2 years. During this open-label phase, participants can request reprogramming and may use either stimulation mode or both, as needed to maintain adequate therapeutic benefit. Statistical methods and data management Data management, including monitoring, is performed by the study sponsor to ensure data completeness and accur- acy. Additionally, a noninvestigator physician Steering Committee performs data review and adjudication. As part of standard practice for IDE studies, the FDA conducts occasional audits of the study conduct, data col- lection, and data management. Study investigators will have access to the data after study closure and will be offered the opportunity to participate as authors on publi- cations. Electronic data capture with appropriate security protocols is used to ensure participant confidentiality during and after the study closure. Statistical analyses will be performed using a signifi- cance level of p = 0.05, unless otherwise specified, and 95% confidence intervals will be computed. Interim analyses for the primary endpoint will occur when all randomized participants complete the 24-week visit; re- sults of that analysis will be submitted for publication. Analyses of the long-term follow-ups will be reported after study closure. Sample size Noninferiority of the VAS score during burst compared with tonic stimulation was assumed to be within a window of 7.5 mm on the 100-mm VAS. Based on earlier reports, the standard deviation of the difference between tonic and burst stimulation VAS scores was assumed to be 18.4 mm. With a type I error rate of 0.05, a minimum sample of 76 participants was required to achieve 80% power to show noninferiority between the two stimulation modes. Previous studies indicate that approximately 29% of sub- jects trialed with tonic stimulation do not receive a per- manent implant and an additional 20% of subjects may be lost to attrition by the 6-month visit [18]. Screen failure rates were originally estimated to be at 15%, but after the first 6 months of enrollment the screen failure rate was amended to 22%. Total enrollment communicated with the regulatory bodies was 173 to account for screen failures, trial evaluation failures, and normal attrition [76/ .71 = 108/.80 = 135/.78 = 173 (rounding up at each step)]. The noninferiority margin was set to preserve at least 50% of the expected effect [19, 20]. Assuming, based upon enrollment criteria and past literature [21], the average baseline pain is approximately 75 mm, a 30% improve- ment in VAS score would be 23 mm. The 7.5-mm margin on the VAS scale would preserve approximately 77% of the effect and would, therefore, be an appropriate margin. Carryover estimations Prior to analysis, measures will be inspected for carryover effects that may be present as a function of time and/or the order of therapy delivery. Carryover effects will be esti- mated using the within-subject sums of the score from week 1 to week 12 and from week 12 to week 24. An inde- pendent two-sided t test will test the null hypothesis of equal within-subject sums between the two sequence groups tonic/burst stimulation and burst/tonic stimula- tion. If the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 0.10 level, then the potential carryover effects are considered negli- gible. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the subsequent analysis will be carried out on the first-period data only. Primary analysis The primary effectiveness analysis is the 12-week nonin- feriority of the within-subject difference between tonic and burst stimulation for the mean daily overall VAS score calculated from the diary. The primary analysis will be conducted using the intention-to-treat popula- tion to include data recorded at the 12- and 24-week visits for all randomized participants, except as noted below. Missing data will be imputed using the hot-deck or last-observation-carried-forward method, as appropri- ate. If participants increase their pain medications dur- ing the first 24 weeks of the study, assessment of the effect of the therapy mode on pain will be confounded by the influence of additional pain medications. Thus, participants who increase pain medication (other than acetaminophen) after randomization will be considered treatment failures for the interval during which the in- crease occurred, and that participant’s baseline mean daily VAS score will be used for that interval in the ana- lysis. A Z-statistic compared with the standard normal distribution will test the null hypothesis that the within- subject difference for the mean overall VAS score is less than or equal to 7.5 mm. Additional analyses For the control phase of the study, a responder analysis will inspect the proportion of participants achieving a Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 8 of 11 change from baseline of 30% or greater for the overall VAS score during each stimulation mode. If noninferiority of burst stimulation is established in the primary endpoint analysis, the superiority of burst versus tonic stimulation will be tested for the overall VAS score using a one-sided t test. The within-subject difference for trunk and limb VAS scores will be inspected using two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The presence of paresthesiae will be compared between the two stimulation modes, and a relative differ- ence of the within-subject experience will be computed. All other measures will be inspected using appropriate descriptive statistics and within-subject comparisons of burst versus tonic stimulation. Additional analyses will also include inspection of results in an intention-to-treat population to include all randomized participants; conser- vative imputations for missing data or participant with- drawal will be made in a manner appropriate to the measure and pattern of missing data. During the open-label phase, type of therapy was chosen by the participant. Appropriate longitudinal statistics will examine long-term outcomes with the device- and participant-selected stimulation modes. Com- parative analyses for burst versus tonic stimulation for this phase will be performed if statistically appropriate. Safety The safety profile of both stimulation modes will be characterized using appropriate descriptive statistics (e.g., incidence rates). Discussion As the first large randomized controlled study of burst stimulation, the design is intended to provide evidence to support FDA approval of the burst neuromodulation wave- form for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain by es- tablishing noninferiority of burst stimulation to traditional tonic stimulation. The results of this study will provide comparative efficacy and safety for burst stimulation in pa- tients who are candidates for traditional SCS. Additionally, data from this study will provide evidence for the psycho- social and functional outcomes during both stimulation modes. The two phases of this study will facilitate compari- sons between the waveforms as well as inspection of prefer- ence and long-term usage patterns for up to 2 years when the leads are placed for tonic stimulation. Chronic pain and responses to neurostimulation are both complex sensory phenomena. The ability to have patients experience the control and experimental stimulation modes is a unique feature of this study design, which should facilitate mean- ingful patient preference assessment. The enrichment strategies for this study design confer advantages for our primary aim. The within-subject comparisons help to control variability in the data such that lead location, programming, and other participant- specific variables are held constant. Additionally, only participants who respond to tonic stimulation during the trial evaluation period and are candidates for a traditional SCS system are randomized, which should minimize par- ticipant attrition while facilitating comparative efficacy in patients who are known candidates for SCS. Ideal elec- trode placement for burst stimulation may not be at the site chosen for tonic stimulation, as in the present study. The same might be true of other waveforms; further study is required to address these points. Furthermore, participants with marked depressive symp- toms are excluded from eligibility in this study. Affective and functional dimensions are reflected in patients’ impres- sion of change – even when a reduction in pain intensity may be considered clinically minimal [22]. Affective disrup- tions commonly associated with pain may also interfere with an accurate assessment of changes in pain intensity. Our study is intended to provide a comparative inspection of pain during burst and tonic stimulation that is largely independent of affective improvements that may indirectly influence participant’s assessment of therapy. We recognize that a minority of chronic pain patients, as few as 14% by some accounts, present without significant depressive symptoms [23, 24]. Excluding participants with depressive symptoms is not expected to limit generalizability, however, because the population included in this design is expected to provide a conservative estimate of pain relief during stimulation. Any direct or indirect benefits to affective function conferred by burst stimulation would be expected to be additive, not exclusive, to the effects on pain. Thus, the results of this study would be expected to approximate, possibly to a lesser degree, the efficacy of burst stimulation for general clinic populations. In contrast, our sample of participants with minimal affective disruption is likely to create a “floor effect” whereby comparative improvements in psychosocial out- comes for burst versus tonic stimulation are unlikely to be detectable. Early evidence indicates that some psycho- social domains may be differentially affected during burst stimulation compared to tonic stimulation [5]; future studies will be needed to target this aspect of the therapy. The cross-over design also imposes some limitations upon the hypotheses that can be addressed with these re- sults. First, the presence of any carryover effects, although not expected, may limit our analysis by reducing the treat- ment window to the first 3-month period – thus leading to a between-subject comparison. Second, we will be un- able to statistically assess changes in pain across time without losing the benefits of the within-subject design. Much of the literature for chronic pain treatments focuses on a calculated change in pain from baseline to follow-up. Our study design is not intended for such an analysis and any inspection of the similar results in our study will lead to limited conclusions, at best. Slavin et al. Trials  (2016) 17:569  Page 9 of 11 As with all studies, the design described herein is not without its limitations; however, this study represents the first large randomized controlled trial comparing the burst waveform with previously approved tonic waveforms. Ul- timately, we expect to collect and report data leading to FDA approval for the device that can offer both burst and tonic waveforms, leading to individualized therapy strat- egies through enhanced therapeutic options.

A higher level evidence supports the use of SCS in treating leg pain than supports back pain, as it is difficult to achieve adequate paresthesia coverage, and then pain relief, in the low back region. In com- parison, 10-kHz high-frequency (HF10 therapy) SCS therapy does not rely on intra- operative paresthesia mapping and remains paresthesia-free during therapy. OBJECTIVE: To compare long-term results of HF10 therapy and traditional low- frequency SCS. METHODS: A pragmatic randomized, controlled, pivotal trial with 24-month follow-up was conducted across 11 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Subjects had Visual Analog Scale scores of $5.0/10.0 cm for both back and leg pain, and were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive HF10 therapy or low-frequency SCS. The primary end point was a responder rate, defined as $50% back pain reduction from baseline at 3 months with a secondary end point at 12 months (previously reported). In this article, 24-month secondary results are presented. Non-inferiority was first assessed, and if demonstrated the results were tested for superiority. RESULTS: In the study, 198 subjects were randomized (101 HF10 therapy, 97 traditional SCS). One hundred seventy-one subjects (90 HF10 therapy, 81 traditional SCS) successfully completed a short-term trial and were implanted. Subjects averaged 54.9 6 12.9 years old, 13.6 6 11.3 years since diagnosis, 86.6% had back surgery, 88.3% were taking opioid analgesics. At 3 months, 84.5% of implanted HF10 therapy subjects were responders for back pain and 83.1% for leg pain, and 43.8% of traditional SCS subjects were responders for back pain and 55.5% for leg pain (P , .001 for both back and leg pain comparisons, non- inferiority and superiority). At 24 months, more subjects were responders to HF10 therapy than traditional SCS (back pain: 76.5% vs 49.3%; 27.2% difference, 95% CI, 10.1%-41.8%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority; leg pain: 72.9% vs 49.3%; 23.6% difference, 95% CI, 5.9%-38.6%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .003 for superiority). Also at 24 months, back pain decreased to a greater degree with HF10 therapy (66.9% 6 31.8%) than tradi- tional SCS (41.1% 6 36.8%, P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority). Leg pain also decreased to a greater degree with HF10 therapy (65.1% 6 36.0%) than traditional SCS (46.0% 6 40.4%, P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .002 for superiority). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates long-term superiority of HF10 therapy com- pared with traditional SCS in treating both back and leg pain. The advantages of HF10 therapy are anticipated to impact the management of chronic pain patients substantially.

Thus for .4 decades, the primary focus of innovation has been to improve the reliability of paresthesia coverage.1,2 However, recent technological innova- tion regarding the delivery of paresthesia-free SCS has shifted focus from optimization of paresthesias to improved patient outcomes, ie, pain relief. With European CE Mark since 2010 and US Food and Drug Administration approval in May 2015, a paresthesia-free therapy provided via high-frequency stimula- tion at 10-kHz (HF10 therapy) now is available to treat both back and leg pain.3-6 With the objective of providing pragmatic clinical evidence, a pivotal trial was designed to demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and clinical benefit of paresthesia-free HF10 therapy compared with traditional paresthesia-based low-frequency SCS for the treatment of chronic intractable back and leg pain.7 In doing so, this study was the first randomized, controlled, pivotal trial in SCS history to compare device systems directly and to use back pain as the primary end point. Details of the study design, participants, interventions, and the results through 12-months have been provided previously.3 Described briefly, HF10 therapy involves application of high- frequency (10 kHz), short-duration (30 msec), low-amplitude (1- 5 mA) pulses to the T8-T11 spinal epidural space, which has been shown to produce no paresthesia. Traditional SCS typically involves application of low-frequency (40-60 Hz), longer duration (300-600 msec), and higher amplitude (4-9 mA) pulses to generate paresthesias as determined by an intraoperative mapping procedure. At the 3-month primary end point, 84.5% of implanted HF10 therapy subjects were responders ($50% reduction in pain from baseline) for back pain and 83.1% for leg pain. In comparison, 43.8% of traditional SCS subjects were responders for back pain and 55.5% for leg pain (P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority for both back and leg pain comparisons). The relative ratio for responders was 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.5) for back pain and 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2-1.9) for leg pain. The superiority of HF10 therapy compared with traditional SCS for leg and back pain was sustained through 12 months (P , .001). None of the HF10 therapy subjects experienced paresthesia. Building on this evidence base, data collection from this study continued to 24 months, providing comparative long-term evidence important to healthcare providers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the comparative sustainability of the results, which is particularly notable in that 24-month follow-up is uncommon in chronic pain studies. METHODS Study Design This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was designed to assess primarily non-inferiority and secondarily superiority of HF10 therapy compared with traditional low-frequency SCS in subjects with chronic intractable back and leg pain. The study was conducted across 11 comprehensive pain treatment centers in the United States in compliance with the US Code of Federal Regulations and recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research by the 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki, Finland. The study protocol and informed consent forms were approved by the Institutional Review Board of each study site (Western Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, WA; Forsyth Medical Center IRB, Winston-Salem, NC). The study was designed initially to assess safety and effectiveness during a 12-month follow-up period. Data collection subsequently was extended for an additional year. Participants Consenting patients under the care of the study investigators were assessed for eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Key inclusion criteria were (1) chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, refractory to conservative therapy for a minimum of 3 months (previous conservative treatments included pain medications, physical therapy, spinal injections, pharmacological, and behavioral treatment); (2) average back pain intensity of $5.0 out of 10.0 cm on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS); (3) average leg pain intensity of $5.0 out of 10.0 cm on the VAS; (4) an Oswestry Disability Index version 2.1a (ODI) score of 41 to 80 out of 1008; and (5) an appropriate candidate for the surgical procedures required in this study. Prior surgical intervention for low back pain was not a study eligibility requirement. Key exclusion criteria were (1) an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, ability to comply with the intervention, or evaluation of treatment outcomes; (2) mechanical spine instability based on flexion/extension films of the lumbar spine; or (3) prior experience with SCS. Near the 12-month follow-up visit, included subjects were asked to re-consent to extended data collection up to 24 months. Randomization and Masking Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive stimulation with either an HF10 therapy system (Senza system; Nevro Corp., Redwood City, California) or a commercially available SCS system (Precision Plus system; Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts). Both SCS systems consisted of two 8- contact leads and a rechargeable implantable pulse generator (IPG). Randomization was stratified by sex and primary area of pain (either back or leg), and administered centrally with each study site assigned randomly chosen alternating blocks of sizes 2, 4, and 6 with frequencies 0.25, 0.50, and 0.25, respectively, as generated by an independent statistician. Consecutive subjects within each site-specific strata block then were assigned sequentially to a treatment group, thus preserving the blinding of the study sites to upcoming treatment group allocations. Study sites were notified by e-mail of each random assignment only after the completion of all baseline assess- ments. Due to practical considerations (see Discussion section), study subjects and investigators were not masked to the assigned treatment group. Procedures Consistent with standard clinical practice, subjects underwent a screen- ing trial of SCS lasting up to 14 days with an external stimulator to determine short-term response. During the trial period, pain was assessed per standard clinical practice. End of trial back and leg pain scores were documented using VAS scales. For traditional SCS subjects, stimulation parameters (pulse frequency, amplitude, and duration; active stimulation contacts) were adjusted optimally to overlap paresthesia with the regions of back and leg pain in the subjects. Paresthesia testing and associated device programming were performed intraoperatively for traditional SCS KAPURAL ET AL 668 | VOLUME 79 | NUMBER 5 | NOVEMBER 2016 www.neurosurgery-online.com subjects, then as needed based on subject feedback at standard clinic visits. Subjects with HF10 therapy received 10 000 Hz, 30 msec stimulation with amplitude and stimulation location adjusted to obtain optimal analgesic response. Because HF10 therapy is paresthesia-free, intra- operative programming was not performed for these subjects. Pro- gramming occurred postoperatively and as needed based on subject feedback at standard clinic visits. Programming for each treatment group was provided with the assistance of the respective manufacturer under the guidance of the investigators. Oral analgesics were stabilized from 28 days prior to enrollment until activation of the implanted SCS system, allowing for perioperative analgesics. Adjustments were allowed subsequently under the guidance of a study investigator as medically necessary, but the study protocol instructed not to exceed baseline levels. The same type of lead was used for both SCS systems. Two percutaneous leads were placed in the posterior spinal epidural space under radiographic imaging and attachedtoeitheranexternalstimulator (during the short-term screening trial) or a subcutaneously implanted IPG. For HF10 therapy, the distal tip of one lead was placed at T8 while a second lead tip was placed at T9, both near anatomical midline. Lead placement for HF10 therapy did not entail confirmation that they were positioned at physiological midline. Lead position for HF10 therapy was based on extensive empirical observation that most patients respond to stimulation application near T9/10, while allowing for patient variation by covering T8-T11.4-6 For traditional low-frequency SCS, leads were placed at vertebral levels based on intraoperative paresthesia mapping involving patient feedback, typically resulting in parallel lead tip placement at T7-T8. A subcutaneous pocket was created using standard surgical technique for placement of the IPG. The leads, anchored conventionally with a manufacturer-supplied anchor, were tunneled to the pocket site and connected to the IPG. Intraoperative impedance testing ensured electrical integrity.

Secondary outcomes included the percentage of subjects who responded for leg pain, the percent pain relief for back and leg pain, and the disability level over the follow-up period. Standardized outcome measures were assessed at predefined study visits (baseline; 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), including VAS for back and leg pain, ODI, patient and clinician global impression of change, and subject satisfaction. The primary end point was at 3 months, with a secondary end point at 12 months (previously published).3 In this article, 24-month secondary results are presented. In addition to adverse event reporting, a standardized neurological assessment (including motor, sensory, and reflex functions) was performed at each of the scheduled visits. Self- reported outcomes were recorded by subjects on case report forms while isolated from research staff and company representatives. Statistical Analysis Primary end point analyses were performed on intention-to-treat (ITT, subjects receiving a randomization assignment), per protocol (PP, subjects completing a primary end point assessment), and permanent implant (PI, subjects passing a short-term screening trial and receiving a permanent SCS system) populations. For subjects who had a successful screening trial and received an IPG implant, the primary efficacy assessment occurred at 3 months post device activation. Subjects who did not have a successful trial phase were considered non-responders for the ITT and PP analyses, and excluded from the PI analysis. As this report focuses on the secondary results at 24 months, the PI analyses are reported. Sample size for efficacy was based on a non-inferiority comparison of the primary end point between treatment groups. Using an exact binomial test for non-inferiority of HF10 therapy to traditional SCS with a 10% non-inferiority margin, 80% statistical power, 0.05 1-sided significance level, and an estimated success rate of 58% for the test group and 48% for the control group,9 a minimum of 77 randomized subjects per treatment group were required. If non-inferiority was statistically demonstrated, then the results were tested for superiority with 2-sided significance. Non-inferiority is established if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference between the primary outcomes of treatment groups(HF10therapy—traditional SCS) is greater than 210%. If HF10 therapy is worse (inferior) than traditional SCS by 10%, then there would be ,2.5% probability of observing non-inferiority by chance alone. If non-inferiority is established, then superiority may be established if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference between the primary outcomes of treatment groups is greater than zero. If HF10 therapy is equal to traditional SCS, then there would be .2.5% probability of observing superiority by chance alone. In addition to classifying subjects as responders ($50% decrease in pain from baseline) or non-responders, subjects were post-hoc classified as remitters or non-remitters. By expert consensus prior to the availability of results, we defined a pain remitter as having a VAS pain score of #2.5 (irrespective of what treatments or medications are utilized).3 Secondary end points were evaluated successively for tests of non- inferiority (hierarchical closed test approach) with 10% non-inferiority margins and 1-sided .05 significance levels until statistical significance was TABLE 1.

For each end point tested, if non-inferiority was demon- strated then superiority was assessed subsequently post hoc with a 2-sided .05 significance level. Secondary end points included percentage changes from baseline in back pain, leg pain, and ODI. Proportions were compared between treatment groups using Fisher exact test with a 2-sided a level of 5%. Longitudinal results were assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Mean results were compared between treatment groups using t tests. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01609972. Study execution was overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, comprising an anesthesiologist, a neurol- ogist, a neurosurgeon, and a biostatistician. RESULTS From June 7, 2012 to December 28, 2012, 241 patients were enrolled and assessed for eligibility with 198 subjects proceeding through baseline evaluations and randomized to a treatment group (101 HF10 therapy, 97 traditional SCS; Figure 1). Of these, 171 subjects had a successful short-term screening trial and were implanted with an SCS system (90 HF10 therapy, 81 traditional SCS). Data were obtained on a high percentage of subjects through 24 months (85 [94.4%] implanted HF10 therapy subjects, 71 [87.7%] implanted traditional subjects, P = .12). Randomized subjects averaged 54.9 6 12.9 years of age, 13.6 6 11.3 years since diagnosis, and 88.3% were taking opioid analgesics with an average morphine-equivalent dose of 118.9 6 119.3 mg/d (Table 1). At baseline, 86.6% of subjects had previous back surgery, with 77.1% diagnosed by a study investigator as having “failed back surgery syndrome.” Other frequent pain diagnoses were radiculopathy in 63.7% of subjects and degenerative disk disease in 62.2% of subjects. Mean baseline back pain VAS was 7.6 6 1.2 cm, while mean baseline leg pain was 7.3 6 1.4 cm. Back pain was the predominant symptom in 54.6% of subjects. For the primary outcome measure, more subjects were responders to HF10 therapy than traditional SCS at 24 months for both back pain (76.5% vs 49.3%; 27.2% difference, 95% CI, 10.1%-41.8%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority) and leg pain (72.9% vs 49.3%; 23.6% difference, 95% CI, 5.9%- 38.6%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .003 for superiority; Figure 2). As non-inferiority was established, superiority analyses were justified. HF10 therapy showed a similar advantage in terms of remission rates at 24 months (back pain: 65.9% vs 31.0%; 34.9% difference, 95%CI,18.0%-49.0%,P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .003 for superiority. Leg pain: 65.9% vs 39.4%; 26.5% difference, 95% CI, 8.0%-41.2%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .001 for superiority). For subjects who achieved remission (including both HF10 therapy and traditional SCS subjects), back pain averaged 1.1 6 0.7 cm and leg pain averaged 0.9 6 0.7 cm. At 24 months, back pain decreased to a greater degree for HF10 therapy subjects (point decrease: 5.0 6 2.5 cm; percent decrease: 66.9% 6 31.8%) than traditional SCS subjects (3.2 6 3.0 cm, P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority; 41.1% 6 36.8%, P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority; Table 2, Figure 3). Similarly, leg pain decreased to a greater degree for HF10 therapy subjects (4.7 6 2.8 cm; or pain scores decrease by 65.1% 6 36.0%) than traditional SCS subjects (3.7 6 3.0 cm, P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .03 for superiority; 46.0% 6 40.4%, P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .002 for superiority). Individual subject responses at 24 months for back and leg pain are shown by treatment group in Figure 4. These charts present the percent decrease in back and leg pain for each study subject, indicating whether each subject was a responder or not. Also at 24 months, HF10 therapy subjects had a favorable distribution of ODI categorizations compared with traditional SCS subjects (P = .02, Table 3), with 23.5% of subjects receiving HF10 therapy having minimal disability compared with 9.9% of FIGURE 2.

Patient and clinician global impression of change and subject satisfaction distributions also reflect the benefits of HF10 therapy compared with traditional SCS. Particularly notable, 60.0% of subjects were very satisfied with HF10 therapy compared with 40.4% of subjects with traditional SCS. There were few study-related serious adverse events in each treatmentgroupat24months,withsimilarratesofoccurrence(5.0% for HF10 therapy, 7.2% for traditional SCS, P = .56, Table 4). Importantly, there were no stimulation-related serious adverse events or neurological deficits in either treatment group. Regarding adverse events that did not reach the level of serious, the most common were implant site pain (in 12.9% of HF10 therapy subjects and 13.4% of traditional SCS subjects, P = .91) and uncomfortable paresthesias (in 0.0% of HF10 therapy subjects and 11.3% of traditional SCS subjects, P , .001). Lead migration resulting in surgical revision occurred in 3.0% of HF10 therapy subjects and 5.2% of traditional SCS subjects (P = .49). DISCUSSION Thisstudydemonstrates notonlythenon-inferiority,butalsothe long-term superiority of HF10 therapy compared with traditional low-frequency SCS in treating both back and leg pain at 24 months. Extending comparative safety and efficacy outcomes from 12 to 24 months provides physicians, patients, and payers with rigorous evidence demonstrating the durability of SCS in treating chronic pain. These results are particularly impressive given the degree of pain chronicity and refractoriness of the study subjects. Randomized controlled trials with substantial follow-up in the SCS field are few. Two previous landmark studies in SCS evaluated subjects with predominant leg pain. In a 2005 study, traditional low-frequency paresthesia-based SCS was compared with reoper- ation, wherein SCS was found to be more effective in treating persistent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery and often obviated the need for reoperation.11 In a 2008 study, traditional SCS was compared with conventional medical management, wherein more subjects randomized to SCS had significant TABLE 2.

The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in reducing chronic pain has been shown to be 2 numeric rating scale points (out of a scale maximum of 10 points) or 30%.13 Putting our study results into context, subjects treated with traditional SCS achieved a 3.2 point average decrease in back pain (which is 1.6 times the 2 point MCID) and a 41.4% average decrease in back pain (which is 1.4 times the 30% MCID), FIGURE 4.

However, subjects treated with HF10 therapy achieved a 5.0 point average decrease in back pain (which is 2.5 times the 2 point MCID) and a 66.9% average decrease in back pain (which is 2.2 times the 30% MCID). Similar ratios were observed for leg pain reduction (traditional SCS: 1.9 and 1.5, respectively; HF10 therapy: 2.2 and 2.2, respectively). Thus, both therapies achieved pain reductions that were beyond the MCID, yet HF10 therapy achieved more than twice the MCID for both back and leg pain reduction. Lack of paresthesias also might be a factor influencing long-term pain control and improvement in function in subjects who received HF10 therapy. Previous studies have suggested that the presence of mildly to intensely uncomfortable paresthesias, including uncomfortable stimulation surges due to patient move- ments or repetitive daily activities, influence the compliance with the use of traditional SCS.1,3 Because HF10 therapy is paresthesia-free, such issues completely are absent and therefore do not impact patients’ compliance with therapy use. Summary statistics are important when comparing the results of 2 treatment groups in clinical trials, and are indeed the proper way to convey results in the context of evidence based medicine. However in clinical practice, individual patient results matter. Figure 4 provides the results of each subject implanted with an SCS system in our clinical trial. Doing so allows physicians and their patients to understand more directly the potential outcomes of the selected therapy when treating chronic back and leg pain. Strengths Strengths of the study include the study design (sufficiently powered multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing 2 TABLE 3.

Limitations As with any clinical trial, there are limitations. Study inves- tigators and subjects were not masked to the assigned treatment group. Subject masking was impractical because low-frequency SCS produces paresthesias, whereas high-frequency SCS does not; thus, the therapies themselves become immediately known to the subjects. Due to the differences in stimulator lead placement, intraoperative testing, and device programming between the treatment groups, the study investigators could not be masked. The effect of the lack of masking in this randomized study is not known; nonetheless, the protocol was based on best practices guidance for comparative efficacy trial designs.14-16 Although the study protocol defined specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, heterogeneity in pain diagnoses was observed, with many subjects having multiple diagnoses (Table 1). This etiological heterogeneity reflects the diversity of patients seen when managing chronic back and leg pain, and is therefore a clinically relevant population to evaluate, especially given the pragmatic nature of this study. Future Directions Future research regarding HF10 therapy is expected to focus on other chronic pain indications such as arm and neck pain, relative cost-effectiveness,17 as well as a better understanding of the mechanism of action. Clinical application of SCS initially was inspired by the Gate Control Theory of pain, which suggested that increased activity of large innocuous afferents presynaptically inhibit input to pain-transmitting projection neurons via inhibitory interneurons, as well as trigger supraspinal circuits that also modify spinal pain processing.18,19 That core concept remains, but the detailed mechanisms of action of traditional SCS (ie, paresthesia-based) still are not understood completely.20 In recent years, preclinical work investigating traditional SCS have suggested new neural interactions (eg, postsynaptic modulation), as well as key neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that may be involved in pain relief from stimulation.21-25 Indeed, attempts to model and understand these circuits beyond the original Gate Control Theory still are emerging.26,27 Given the gross clinical similarity of application, HF10 therapy also may work with these same neural structures, yet may modulate them in a different manner (eg, desynchronization) in such a way that yields a more robust clinical outcome.28 Additional research is needed to detail the direct spinal effects of HF10 therapy. CONCLUSION The advantages of HF10 therapy are anticipated to impact the management of patients with chronic back and leg pain sub- stantially, and possibly other pain conditions. The superior and durable results demonstrated in this study are anticipated to lead to improved long-term cost effectiveness and payer acceptance, making this therapy broadly available to patients suffering from chronic pain.

COMMENTS S pinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used as a modality to treat chronic pain since 1967 when Dr Shealy implanted the first spinal cord stimulator in a terminally ill patient with bronchogenic carcinoma and right lower chest pain.1 Since then there have been advances in lead and battery design, understanding bioelectrical mechanisms, and stim- ulation methodology. This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial compares the efficacy of high-frequency SCS with traditional SCS for the treatment of intractable leg and back pain. The authors found that both back and leg pain decreased to a greater degree for 10-kHz high- frequency (HF10) therapy patients (66.9% and 65.1%, respectively) at 2 years. Additionally, the streamlined implantation and programming of HF10 systems offers significant benefit to the clinician and is exciting from a workflow perspective. A major limitation to this study is the lack of blinding. Although the improvement in visual analog scale was sta- tistically significant, patients knew which stimulator (newer vs older technology) they received, inherently biasing their perceptions. Fur- thermore, the traditional stimulation that was used was not the latest generation of SCS offered. That said, the current study makes a mean- ingful contribution to the pain literature by demonstrating how far SCS technology has come since the PROCESS trial when 48% of patients achieved .50% leg pain, but not back pain relief, at similar follow-up.2 The efficacy of SCS for predominant back pain with latest-generation technology changes our patient selection criteria and expands the pool of patients that may benefit from neuromodulation. Most interesting, scientifically, is that HF10 dispels previous beliefs on SCS mechanism of action, namely that paresthesias are needed. Now that we know this is not the case, we must reframe our understanding of how SCS works. The next step clinically to improve our understanding of HF10 and other new technologies is to determine which patients benefit from which parameters both through subjective and objective outcomes.3 Sebastian Rubino Julie G.

T he authors present 24-month data from an industry-sponsored ran- domized trial, comparing traditional, low-frequency, paresthesia- producing spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to a new non-paresthesia- generating SCS system delivering 10-kHz high-frequency (HF10) stim- ulation. At 24-month follow-up, more subjects were responsive to HF10 therapy than standard SCS and had a greater degree of pain relief both for back and leg pain. Although traditional SCS has a long track record and a number of well-designed randomized trials to its name, for a variety of reasons it remains stigmatized by many in the medical community. Thus, this study demonstrating superior outcomes to traditional SCS is a wel- come addition to the field. A number of concerns: 1. The authors introduce the term “remitters,” defined as those with a VAS score of ,2.5 after treatment. I would recommend using this term in a prudent and cautious fashion. As the authors note, this does not take into account any changes in pharmacologic therapy. Moreover, the field of chronic pain is littered with the carcasses of interventions initially thought to be near-panaceas that were later found to be, at the very best, effective for a select group of patients, and, at worst, marginally effective or ineffective in the long-term. As traditional SCS has a much longer track record than HF10 therapy, and as the mechanism of action of HF10 therapy is unknown, the longevity of efficacy of this therapy remains unclear. 2. The authors mention that the paresthesias produced by “tradi- tional” SCS can influence compliance with therapy usage. I have rarely found this to be a significant problem—indeed, for some patient groups (ie, the elderly), absence of paresthesias may be deleterious to ensuring compliance. I would suggest that more emphasis be placed on the superior outcomes of this therapy vs traditional SCS as opposed to the perceived benefits of paresthesia- free stimulation. 3. Traditionally, when SCS has been effective in the treatment of back pain, it has been for the constant, “neuropathic” component of the pain as opposed to a more mechanical-type, nociceptive pain, frequently experienced even in the absence of instability. Although the authors specifically excluded patients with instability on dynamic spine x-rays, I would warn against using SCS of any type to treat primary axial back as opposed to radicular pain, or mixed pain with a predominant radicular component. 4. A concern particularly relevant to the neurosurgical community is the lack of availability of a surgical, ie, paddle-type lead. The majority of SCS systems placed by neurosurgeons (as opposed to non-surgical specialists such as anesthesiologists) are paddle leads, as most neuro- surgeons are not trained in or comfortable with percutaneous lead placement. Furthermore, in a subset of patients where percutaneous access cannot be obtained (ie, extensive spinal fusions), a paddle electrode is the only option. Given these initial promising results, I would imagine that such a lead will be available in the near future. It is likely that the future of SCS therapy will not be a “one-size-fits- all” approach—traditional tonic paresthesia-producing stimulation, high-frequency stimulation, “burst” stimulation, and newer targets such as the dorsal root ganglion may, individually or in combination, benefit different subclasses of patient, and even the same patient at different times. At the present time, we have no data to guide our choice of therapy in a particular patient, and I am pessimistic that high- quality data will be available in the near future. Thus, devices that have the ability to provide all of these therapies likely will capture the majority of the market share. Alon Y.

This problem has led to a search for new and innovative  treatment modalities, including neuromodulation of the occipital nerves.  Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to describe an implantation technique  for the Bion® microstimulator and document stimulation parameters and stimulation  maps after Bion placement adjacent to the greater occipital nerve. The secondary aim  is to document outcome measures one year post-implant.  Design: Prospective, observational feasibility study.  Methods: Nine patients with medically refractory primary headache disorders  participated in this study. Approximately 6 months after Bion insertion, stimulation  parameters and maps were documented for all patients. At one year, outcome  measures were collected including the Migraine Disability Assessment Score.  Results: At 6 months, the mean perception threshold was 0.47 mA, while the  mean discomfort threshold was 6.8 mA (stimulation range 0.47 – 6.8 mA). The mean  paresthesia threshold was 1.64 mA and the mean usage range was 16.0. There were  no major complications reported such as device migration, infection, or erosion. One  patient stopped using her Bion before the 12-month follow-up visit. At one year, 7  of the 8 patients were judged as having obtained fair or better results in terms of  reduction of disability; 5 patients had greater than a 90% reduction in disability.  Limitations: Small, heterogeneous patient population without control group. Not  blinded or randomized. Conclusion: The Bion can be successfully inserted adjacent to the greater occipital  nerve in an effort to treat refractory primary headache disorders. This microstimulator  may provide effective occipital stimulation and headache control while minimizing the  risks associated with percutaneous or paddle leads implanted subcutaneously in the  occipital region.

Previous studies have evaluated Bion  implantation for pudendal nerve neuromodulation in  the setting of refractory detrusor overactivity inconti- nence (14,15). At our institution, we have implanted 9  Bion microstimulators adjacent to the greater occipital  nerve (GON) in an effort to treat refractory headache  disorders.  The primary aim of this feasibility study is to de- scribe an implantation technique for the Bion micro- stimulator and document stimulation parameters and  stimulation maps after Bion placement adjacent to  the GON. The secondary aim is to document outcome  measures one year post-implant. Methods After the United States Food and Drug Adminis- tration (IDE G030225) and Institutional Review Board  approval of this feasibility study, 9 patients diagnosed  with chronic migraine or chronic cluster headache  presenting to our clinic were screened for inclusion  and exclusion. All 9 patients met the inclusion and ex- clusion criteria and all agreed to participate. Written  informed consent was obtained from each. Inclusion  criteria included 18 years of age or older, 12 or more  months of chronic migraine or chronic cluster head- ache, refractory to at least 4 preventative medications  used at adequate dosage for adequate duration of  time, willingness to maintain current pain medica- tion regimen during the study, and willingness and  ability to maintain a headache diary for the duration  of the study. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or  planned pregnancy, previous surgery in the occipital  region, and participation in a device or drug trial with- in the previous 30 days.  All patients underwent a detailed neurologic  exam and were assigned a diagnosis based on the In- ternational Classification of Headache Disorders – II  (16). Six patients had chronic cluster headache includ- ing one with migraines and one with hemicrainia con- tinua, and 3 patients had chronic migraine only (Table  1). Each patient underwent a psychiatric evaluation  to determine their psychological stability to undergo  the procedure. The patients did not undergo a trial of  stimulation or occipital nerve block before implanta- tion of the Bion.  For the purposes of this study, and consistent with  our previous study on occipital stimulation mapping  M igraine is the most common form of  disabling primary headache, affecting  12% of Caucasian populations (1). Cluster  headache and hemicrania continua, although much  less common, also have a significant negative impact  on quality of life (2,3). Subcutaneous occipital nerve  stimulation (ONS) has been reported to effectively  treat medically refractory primary headache disorders.  A number of recent studies have documented efficacy  outcomes and stimulation parameters associated with  ONS (4-10). These studies document off-label use of  spinal cord stimulation technology to stimulate the  distal branches of the C1-3 nerve roots. Prospective,  multicenter studies are underway to determine the  safety and efficacy of this modality (11). The implantable Bion microstimulator was ini- tially developed as a radiofrequency (RF) powered  functional electrical stimulator (12). However, the  Bion microstimulator (from Boston Scientific Neuro- modulation Corporation, Valencia, CA) (Fig. 1) used in  this study is the only battery powered microstimulator  of its type and as such does not require an external  RF power source. It includes a single cathode on one  end and a single anode on the other. Currently an  investigational device, the Bion contains a program- mable microchip, stimulating electrodes, telemetry  capability, and a transcutaneously rechargeable (3  milliamp hours) lithium ion battery (13). It is expected  that the battery will lose no more than 30% of its ca- pacity after 500 cycles of full charge and discharge.  www.painphysicianjournal.com   623 Occipital Stimulation via the Bion (9), the following definitions were used: perception  threshold is the lowest current amplitude that elicits  sensation. Perception threshold is assumed to repre- sent local tissue stimulation, while the upper end of  the stimulation range (discomfort threshold) is de- fined as the current amplitude where patients feel  stimulation strongly and do not wish the stimulation  to be increased any further. The stimulation range  (perception through discomfort threshold) represents  the useful amplitudes for any given electrode combi- nation while the usage range (discomfort threshold  divided by perception threshold) “represents the rela- tive size of the therapeutic stimulating window” (17).  Paresthesia threshold is the current amplitude where  the patient first noted stimulation traveling toward  the vertex of his head, suggesting direct GON stimu- lation. The maximum stimulation tested during the  study was 10 milliamps (mA).  The Bion implantation procedure was carried out  under monitored anesthesia care in the prone position.  Antibiotic prophylaxis was given to each patient before  incision. The goal of each implant was to position the  Bion microstimulator subcutaneously in the occipital  region at a right angle to the GON, with the cathode  immediately adjacent to the nerve. The anatomy of this  region has recently been reviewed (8,18), and a cadaver  study noted that in 10 specimens (20 nerves), the GON  ascended between 5 and 28 mm from the midline at  the level of the intermastoid line (19).  First, using fluoroscopic guidance, a line was  drawn between the tips of the mastoid processes (in- termastoid line) and in the midline. After sterile prep  and injection of local anesthetic for skin wheal, a small  (< 1 cm) incision was made 3 cm contralateral to the  side of intended GON stimulation. Next, a 20-gauge, 15  cm insulated stimulating needle was inserted through  the incision and across the midline toward the side to  be stimulated. The ideal depth was estimated to be  below the dermis but superficial to the fascia, in the  subcutaneous fat layer. The location of the GON was  marked as the point where the patient experienced  maximal stimulation induced paresthesia towards the  vertex of their head, at least to the level of the top of  the ear.

Pain Physician: May/June 2009: 12:621-628 624   www.painphysicianjournal.com Next, the stimulating needle was removed and  the Bion introducer with the dissector/stimulator was  inserted through the incision. The Bion dissector/stim- ulator was used to confirm the location of the GON,  after which the Bion was deployed adjacent to the  GON using the Bion placement tool and holder (Figs.  2,3).  Post implantation management included device  activation 7–10 days postoperatively in 7 of the pa- tients and activation on the day of implant in 2 pa- tients. The timing of device activation was based on  patient preference and travel considerations. The pa- tients were initially given a radiofrequency “pillow”  charger; a smaller “butterfly” charger subsequently  became available that could be attached to a hat,  allowing the patient to recharge while upright. The  patients were instructed to initially use the Bion con- stantly at low amperage and then to increase the am- perage as needed to treat intermittent headache exac- erbations. However, they were given the prerogative  to adjust use to comfort and effect. Patients turned  stimulation on or off, and adjusted the amplitude of  stimulation, via a wireless remote control. Approximately 6 months after implantation, the  following data were gathered in addition to the data  collected as part of the sponsored study: headache lo- cation, average number of hours of Bion use per day,  frequency of recharging, pulse width and rate, per- ception threshold with associated paresthesia map,  discomfort threshold with associated paresthesia map,  and paresthesia threshold. The patients were given a  map of the head (Fig. 4) to allow them to identify the  location of their baseline headaches and areas where  they perceived stimulation. Mean values with standard  deviation (SD) were used to summarize the data.  Migraine Disability Assessment Scores (MIDAS)  were obtained prior to and at 12 months after implan- tation of the stimulator. The MIDAS questionnaire is a  validated headache-related disability instrument that  is increasingly used as a surrogate measure of outcome  in episodic and chronic migraine trials (20). The 5-ques- tion instrument quantifies time lost due to headache  from work, school, household work, and social/family  or leisure activities over the preceding 3 months. The  score is typically reported in a 3-digit format (e.g. 106- 75-7): The first number is the MIDAS (greater than 20  is considered severe), the second number is the num- ber of days in the past 3 months that the patient had a  headache (max 90), and the third number is the aver- age severity of each headache (0–10 scale).  www.painphysicianjournal.com   625 Occipital Stimulation via the Bion Results All 9 patients invited to participate signed in- formed consent. One patient completed the head- ache maps approximately 4 months after implant. She  subsequently did not appear for her 6-month follow- up and stopped using the Bion before study comple- tion at 12 months. She stated the battery recharging  schedule was too demanding, specifically that she was  spending 1.5 hours recharging her Bion for every 1.5  hours of use. Patient demographics, baseline usage  data, and MIDAS are summarized in Table 1. The mean  decrease in number of days with headache for the 8  patients who completed the study was 28.5 (SD 29.6),  while the average headache severity score decreased  by 0.88 (SD 1.36). More detailed outcome data contin- ues to be analyzed and will be presented separately. Self-reported stimulator usage ranged from 30  minutes every 2 weeks to 24 hours/day (mean 12.2  hours/day, median 16 hours/day), and recharging fre- quency ranged from 35 minutes per week to 4 hours  per day (mean 1.67 hours/day, median 1.5 hours/day).  Distribution of baseline headache and stimulation  thresholds (perception and discomfort) are shown in  Table 2 (see Fig. 4 for maps). The zones of stimula- tion as noted in Table 2 are not meant to imply that  the patients felt paresthesia throughout the entire  zone; rather, they recorded stimulation in some part  of each area noted. Table 3 summarizes stimulation  parameters, including a mean perception threshold of  0.47 mA and a mean discomfort threshold of 6.8 mA  (stimulation range 0.47 – 6.8 mA). The mean pares- thesia threshold was 1.64 mA, and the mean usage  range was 16.0. The average tissue impedance was  1.34 kilo-ohms. No patients reported major device-related com- plications during the 12-month duration of the study  Fig. 4.

Adverse events  reported after the study was complete at 12 months  included loss of stimulation (N = 1). The patient’s Bion  had malfunctioned and was unrechargeable, requiring  replacement. This patient subsequently experienced  an infection necessitating explant and reimplant of a  third Bion. Minor adverse events included 2 patients  who complained of muscle stimulation at high ampli- tudes, and one patient who complained of pain near  the implant site.  discusson Millions of patients suffer from primary headache  disorders; a portion of them, like the patients in this  study, endure severe, medically refractory pain. This  problem has led to a search for new and innovative  treatment modalities, including neuromodulation of  the occipital nerves. A number of recent studies have suggested that  stimulation of the distal branches of the C1-2-3 nerve  roots can produce pain relief in patients with otherwise  refractory headache disorders (21-24). The mechanism  of analgesia may be due to inhibition of nociceptive  specific neurons in the trigeminal-cervical complex.  Electrical stimulation of the GON may also result in mo- bilization of central pain modulatory centers (25,26).  Of note, we previously reported pain relief despite  persistent cranial autonomic activity (lacrimation, rhi- norrhoea, conjunctival injection) in 2 of these patients  implanted with Bions (27). One patient was diagnosed  with cluster headache, while the other was diagnosed  with hemicrania continua. This separation of autonomic  signs from analgesia suggests that the autonomic fea- tures and first division pain are dissociated and sepa- rately controlled from a supranuclear generator.  While previous occipital stimulation techniques  have resulted in diffuse distal C1-2-3 stimulation via  cylindrical (percutaneous) or paddle (surgical) spinal  cord stimulator (SCS) leads (4-7), the Bion was used  here to stimulate a limited area and a specific nerve  (GON). Our approach assumed that GON stimulation  will have the same central analgesic affect as more  diffuse C1-2-3 stimulation via percutaneous stimulator  leads. If this assumption is correct, clinicians may be  able to achieve the benefits of occipital stimulation  via a microstimulator while circumventing the techni- cal problems associated with occipital percutaneous  leads and remote power sources.  In terms of stimulation parameters and the Bion,  all of the patients had a sensory threshold of less than  one milliamp, suggesting local tissue stimulation,  while several patients had discomfort thresholds at  the maximum tested amplitude of 10 mA. The mean  paresthesia threshold of 1.64 mA suggests that at this  amperage the GON was being stimulated directly. The  large usage range (16.0, SD 8.2) indicates wide varia- tion between these patients in terms of the size of  their therapeutic stimulating windows. Lengthy daily  usage time and high rates of stimulation (pulses per  second) will increase recharging frequency.  Table 3. Bion Tested Stimulation Parameters.

In that  study, the mean perception threshold was higher (1.07  V), while the discomfort threshold (3.63 V) was lower  than the Bion (Table 3). The average tissue impedance  in this study (1.34 kilo-ohms) is close to 1.0 kilo-ohms,  allowing us to assume that the mA recorded for the  Bion are roughly equivalent to the volts recorded in  our previous study of SCS leads. The Bion’s proximity to  the GON may explain its lower perception threshold,  while the reason for the higher discomfort threshold  for the Bion is more obscure. Diffuse tissue stimulation  produced by SCS leads may increase the likelihood of  patient discomfort. In terms of paresthesia mapping, it is difficult to  determine if a correlation exists between distribution  of paresthesia (Table 2 and Fig. 4) and outcome, but  a pattern did not appear to emerge. Despite the Bi- on’s small size, we were able to produce paresthesia  in remote areas of the head, including at least one  patient who noted trigeminal distribution paresthe- sia. It is unknown if outcome is improved by covering  patient’s baseline headache regions with paresthesia,  analogous to spinal cord stimulation.  The MIDAS was used as a measure of outcome in  this study. At one year, 7 of the 8 patients were judged  as having obtained fair or better results in terms of  reduction of disability; 5 patients had greater than  90% reduction in disability. All patients with excellent  outcomes experienced a > 50% reduction in headache  days and/or 30–50% reduction in average headache se- verity, while patients with a fair response experienced  a reduction in headache days or severity of 25–50%. The Bion’s small size and low profile may help  minimize or eliminate device displacement and lead  breakage problems associated with SCS equipment  implanted subcutaneously in the occipital region. As  recently reviewed (10), complications of SCS systems  implanted in the occipital region can occur frequently  with lead migration rates as high as 100%. Other re- ported complications include lead fracture or discon- nection, infection, erosion, and allergic reaction. The Bion microstimulator requires no anchoring  or tunneling of extensions to remote power sources;  as such, much of the mechanical stress on the occipi- tal stimulator system is eliminated. However, it is pos- sible that a foreign body such as the Bion can move  within tissue planes or become encapsulated, hence  increasing the energy required to stimulate the oc- cipital nerve. As a current controlled device, the Bion  has the (limited) ability to automatically adjust the  voltage to maintain the current amplitude despite  encapsulation. Disadvantages of a microstimulator system include  the need for frequent recharging and limited choices  in terms of electrode combinations. Future versions of  this device may include a larger battery and multiple  electrodes. Limitations of this feasibility study include its small  and heterogeneous patient population without a con- trol group. It was neither randomized nor blinded. This  however was a pilot study to ascertain the feasibility  of the technique and potential for this modality in the  treatment of refractory primary headache disorders.  Thus far, there are no randomized controlled studies  published on the safety or efficacy of any occipital  nerve stimulation device for the treatment of primary  headache disorders. The results of this feasibility study  would support randomized controlled trials with the  Bion microstimulator in this patient population. Po- tentially, a blinded study could be carried out wherein  Bion microstimulators would be inserted in both a  treatment and a placebo group. The treatment group  would receive stimulation immediately after implant,  while the placebo group would not have their Bion  microstimulators activated for several months. A  blinded, head to head comparison of the Bion micro- stimulator to other ONS systems that use spinal cord  stimulation equipment could be more difficult to carry  out, as the spinal cord stimulators systems require a  remote battery implant. In this scenario, it would not  be possible to “blind” the patient as to which system  was implanted.  conclusion In conclusion, we have documented paresthesia  maps and stimulation parameters for 9 patients after  permanent implantation of a Bion microstimulator,  with one year outcome data. There were no major ad- verse events during the study period, including device  migration or infection. One patient did not complete  the study. Further studies are needed to evaluate the  safety and efficacy of subcutaneous C1-2-3 stimula- tion for headache disorders, including the use of mi- crostimulators to stimulate specific nerves. If this novel  microstimulator is shown to be effective in random- ized trials, it may be possible to achieve headache  control via neurostimulation with a low incidence of  long-term complications.

A  comparison of two patient groups receiving spinal cord  stimulation therapy  Nick Pak, Daniel A Devcich, Malcolm H Johnson, Alan F Merry  Abstract  Aim To compare psychological and pain-related characteristics of patients with  chronic pain and patients with refractory angina pectoris who had been treated with  spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy.   Method Twenty-four patients receiving SCS therapy were interviewed. Four  psychological variables were assessed using standardised questionnaires for pain  catastrophising, health locus of control, anxiety sensitivity, and self-efficacy. Patients  also completed the revised version of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, the  Short-Form Health Survey, and self-reported measures of global perceived effect,  pain, functionality, and satisfaction with SCS therapy.   Results Most patients reported improvements in pain, functionality, and improvement  overall. Some health locus of control dimensions were significantly higher for the  angina group than the chronic pain group, and chronic angina patients reported  significantly lower levels of intermittent pain. Virtually all patients reported being  satisfied with SCS therapy.  Conclusion Most self-rated psychological and pain-related characteristics were no  different between the two groups, which gives some support to the view that  refractory angina is a form of chronic pain. The results also add to evidence  supporting the use of SCS therapy for refractory angina pectoris; however, differences  observed on a few variables may indicate points of focus for the assessment and  treatment of such patients.  Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy has been used for over four decades in a variety  of chronic pain conditions and for over two decades in refractory angina pectoris. The  UK-based National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended SCS  therapy for chronic neuropathic pain conditions but not for refractory angina,1  because, for the latter, randomised controlled trial evidence shows that SCS therapy is  merely equivalent to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)2 and percutaneous  myocardial laser revascularisation.3 This is an interesting perspective, given that the  risks of CABG surgery are considerably greater than those of SCS.2  In New Zealand, patients with chronic pain and patients with refractory angina  pectoris have been treated with SCS therapy in pain clinics for at least the past 15  years. In these clinics, prior to commencing SCS therapy, patients with chronic pain  are typically assessed for intensive (e.g., three-week, full-time) pain management  programmes consisting of education, relaxation training, and activation components.       NZMJ 28 March 2014, Vol 127 No 1391; ISSN 1175 8716  Page 53  URL: http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/127-1391/6051/  ©NZMA       In some cases, by contrast, patients with refractory angina pectoris may progress to  SCS therapy without undergoing any psychological assessment or undertaking a pain  management programme. However, given that several psychological characteristics  that correlate with chronic pain may influence the outcomes of SCS therapy despite  technical success,4 it is worth asking whether this approach allows adequate  opportunity to identify patients with refractory angina pectoris who may not respond  well to SCS therapy.  As with other chronic pain conditions, it has been shown that cognitive-behavioural  interventions for refractory angina pectoris can improve symptoms and quality of life5  as well as reduce hospitalisations and myocardial infarctions.6 While these studies add  value as examples of applied research that addresses alternative treatment options for  these patients, they also raise the theoretical question of whether refractory angina  pectoris may be considered within the spectrum of chronic pain conditions. If so, this  may place more emphasis on the importance of the psychological assessment of  patients with refractory angina pectoris and may have implications for clinical  pathways in treating the condition.  The aim of this study was to provide a descriptive account of psychological and pain- related characteristics of two patient groups receiving SCS therapy: patients with  refractory angina pectoris and patients with chronic pain. We were interested in  assessing variables that have been shown to predict aspects of functioning and  outcomes in patients with chronic pain, and we also took the opportunity to assess  levels of satisfaction with SCS therapy.  Method  Participants—Patients who had received SCS implantation through The Auckland Regional Pain  Service (TARPS) in Auckland, New Zealand before the end of September 2010 and who were still  using it were invited to participate in the study. The inclusion period ran from July 1991 through to  September 2010, and there were no exclusion criteria for patients other than their decision to not  participate.   Thirty-four out of a total of 57 patients were eligible to participate in the study. Exclusions included 13  patients who had stimulators inserted over the trial period but had discontinued using them (5 patients  with chronic pain and 8 with refractory angina pectoris) and 10 angina patients who had since  deceased. Of the 34 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 24 agreed to take part—12 patients with  chronic pain, 12 with refractory angina pectoris. Patients who were unwilling to take part in the study  cited poor health (n=4) and personal reasons (n=2), and of the four remaining non-participating  patients, two were unable to take part because of pending surgery and overseas travel, respectively, and  the remaining two were unable to be contacted by the researchers.  Procedure—The study was approved by the New Zealand Ministry of Health Northern Y Regional  Ethics Committee (NTY/09/114/EXP). Eligible patients were contacted by mail and telephone and  were invited to participate in the study. Participation involved an interview of approximately two hours  in length at Mercy Hospital in Auckland. Patients’ travel expenses were reimbursed through research  donations provided by Medtronic and Advanced Neuromodulation Systems (ANS). The interviews  were conducted by a medical student (NP) trained in interview methods by a clinical psychologist  (MHJ), who also monitored the first day of interviews. Neither researcher was involved in the clinical  management of the participants.   During the interviews, participants completed a questionnaire comprising various standardised  measures to assess pain relief, quality of life, functionality, and a selection of psychological  characteristics. After their interview, patients were offered the opportunity to be seen by the SCS nurse  specialist for an adjustment of their stimulator and to discuss any unresolved issues if necessary. The  research nurse was also present and available to provide assistance if required at all times during the  interviews. Once all data were collected, analysis was conducted using SPSS statistical software.

Measures  Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS)7—The PCS is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses pain  catastrophising—the disposition to negatively evaluate pain and one’s ability to deal with it—which  has been linked to higher levels of psychological distress and pain-related disability.7 Patients are asked  to indicate the degree to which particular thoughts and feelings are associated with their experience of  pain on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0=not at all; 4=all the time). Item scores are summed to give an  assessment of pain catastrophising (range=0–52), and scores for subscales measuring rumination,  magnification, and helplessness are yielded similarly by summing the relevant items.   Pain catastrophising scores of 30 or more are considered clinically relevant, as 70% of chronic pain  patients scoring above 30 describe themselves as totally occupationally disabled, and 66% report  moderate depression.8 Good to excellent levels of reliability and validity have been reported for the  measure (including subscales) among chronic pain populations.9  Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)10—Self-efficacy is a measure of confidence that someone  has in his or her ability to engage in a course of action sufficient to achieve a desired outcome.11 High  self-efficacy has been correlated with lower pain, less psychological distress, and better outcomes to  medical treatments.10   Comprising 10 items, the PSEQ assesses patients’ confidence in accomplishing daily activities while in  pain. Responses are made on a seven-point rating scale (0=not confident at all; 6=completely  confident), and a final score is produced by summing all responses (range=0–60), with higher scores  signifying stronger pain self-efficacy beliefs. Normative data from a large sample of patients with  chronic pain show mean PSEQ scores ranging from 24.9 to 28.5, depending on the site of the pain, and  an overall mean of 25.5 across all patients.12 Studies have reported evidence of construct validity and  excellent internal consistency in research involving patients with chronic pain.13,14  Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)15—The 16-item ASI assesses beliefs about the harmful consequences  of anxiety-related symptoms (i.e., anxiety sensitivity: the fear of anxiety and related sensations that  arise from the belief that these sensations can have harmful physical, psychological, or social  consequences).16 Each item—a statement relating to a possible negative consequence (e.g., fear,  embarrassment, etc.) of the experience of anxiety—is rated by patients on a five-point scale (0=very  little; 4=very much).   Summing the scores of the items gives a final score of sensitivity to anxiety (range=0–64), with  normative data indicating an overall ASI mean of around 19.0 among European and American  samples.17 Higher scores on the ASI in patients with persistent pain have been shown to be associated  with greater disability, pain, and distress;18 higher scores are also related to higher fear of pain, which  in turn is linked to reduced activity and movement.19 Research into the psychometric properties of the  ASI has revealed high internal consistency (α=.88), with factor and correlational analyses  demonstrating meaningful construct independence from standard measures of anxiety.16   Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC)20—The 18-item MHLC (Form C) measures  individuals’ beliefs about the extent to which they are able to control the status of their health—that is,  whether control beliefs are oriented towards factors that are internal or external (i.e., chance, doctors,  and other people).21 The MHLC requires respondents to score each item, a statement about their health,  on a six-point Likert-type scale (1=strongly disagree; 6=strongly agree). Scores are summed for each of  the four Form C subscales (ranges=6–36 for the internality and chance subscales and 3–18 for the  doctors and other people subscales).   High scores on a particular subscale indicate stronger representations of the related locus of control— higher scores on the internality subscale, for example, represent stronger beliefs that one’s health status  is largely influenced by personal factors, indicating that these individuals are more likely to take  responsibility for their own health, while high doctors and other people scores suggest the individuals  are more likely to believe that interventions by others will be necessary to manage their health. Since  publication, the MHLC has been used widely, with a majority of studies showing good support for the  validity, reliability, and the multidimensional structure of the measure.21-23  Demographic and other pain-related variables—The study questionnaire also comprised some  standard, psychometrically robust measures commonly used in pain research. Patient disability was  assessed using the physical functioning scale of the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36),24 a widely used      NZMJ 28 March 2014, Vol 127 No 1391; ISSN 1175 8716  Page 55  URL: http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/127-1391/6051/  ©NZMA       health-related quality-of-life measurement tool that incorporates assessments of physical and mental  health status. Sensory and affective dimensions of pain experience were measured with the 22-item  revised version of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2),25 which has been validated  for both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions. In addition, we collected data on a range of  demographic variables (age, gender, and ethnicity), and, using three seven-point scales (1=completely  recovered; 7=worse than ever), self-reported perceptions of global effectiveness, pain, and functionality  in relation to SCS therapy were also measured (e.g., “How would you rate your level of function now  compared with before you had your spinal cord stimulator inserted?”).   Finally, as an assessment of patients’ satisfaction with SCS therapy, two dichotomous items on  patients’ willingness to (1) go through the procedure again and (2) have their spinal cord stimulator  repaired (should the need arise) were also included in the study questionnaire.

They were also well balanced in respect of their perception of the  effects of SCS and in their satisfaction with this therapy (see Table 2). However,  patients with refractory angina pectoris were, on average, older than patients with  chronic pain (mean difference of 11.4 years, p=0.03), and while all but one of the  patients with chronic pain had a formal psychological assessment prior to stimulator  insertion, no patients with angina underwent such assessment.

Five patients in the chronic pain group participated in a clinic-administered pain  management programme, which focussed on education, relaxation, and activation  across an intensive 3-week period. No patients with refractory angina pectoris  underwent such a programme.  Pain characteristics (see Table 2) were mostly comparable across the two patient  groups: between-group differences in subscale scores of the SF-MPQ-2 were not  observed for most of the measure’s pain dimensions (i.e. continuous pain, neuropathic  pain, and affective descriptors). However, patients with chronic pain reported  experiencing significantly more intermittent pain than patients with angina (15.08 vs.  3.33, p<0.05). Levels of disability (physical functioning scale of the SF-36) were  similar across the two groups—18.09 for patients with chronic pain and 17.33 for  patients with refractory angina pectoris.  In the questionnaire, patients were asked to rate their perceptions of the effect of SCS.  To assist analysis, we split participants’ responses (which were made on seven-point  scales) into two categories: (1) improved, which incorporated responses of      NZMJ 28 March 2014, Vol 127 No 1391; ISSN 1175 8716  Page 57  URL: http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/127-1391/6051/  ©NZMA       ‘completely recovered’, ‘much improved’, and ‘slightly improved’ (scores 1–3 on the  scale) and (2) not improved, which combined the ‘no change’, ‘slightly worsened’,  ‘much worsened’, and ‘worse than ever’ responses (scores 4–7).   Results showed that perceptions of the efficacy of SCS therapy were mostly  favourable: with few exceptions, the majority of patients in both groups reported  improvement overall (global effect) since beginning SCS therapy; likewise, most  patients in both groups reported improvements in pain and functionality. Patient  satisfaction with SCS therapy was high across both groups, with nearly all patients  indicating they would repeat the procedure and would have their spinal cord  stimulator repaired (e.g., new lead inserted) if the need arose. Two patients in the  chronic pain group indicated they would not undergo the procedure again.  Analysis of the psychological characteristics data (see Table 3) revealed many  parallels between the two patient groups. Specifically, no significant between-group  differences were found with regard to pain catastrophising, self-efficacy, and anxiety  sensitivity. It is worth noting, however, that PCS scores for patients with refractory  angina pectoris appeared to be approaching clinical significance cut-offs for pain  catastrophising.  Between-group differences were observed for some of the MHLC subscales: the  chance dimension of the MHLC was significantly higher in the angina group than in  the chronic pain group (14.08 vs. 20.09, p=0.01), indicating that patients with  refractory angina pectoris were more likely to hold beliefs about fate and luck as  determinant factors of their pain condition and outcomes. The same trend was found  for the doctors subscale, where significantly higher scores (which indicate stronger  beliefs that health status is predominantly influenced or determined by doctors and  medically trained professionals) were observed among patients with refractory angina  pectoris (11.46 vs. 15.08, p=0.01).

For the most part, between-group differences in self-reported disability and pain  experience across the dimensions of the SF-MPQ-2 could not be detected in the  data—the only exception being the results from the intermittent subscale, where  patients with refractory angina pectoris reported significantly less intensity with  regard to intermittent-type symptoms (e.g., ‘shooting pain’, ‘sharp pain’). Virtually all  patients reported improvements following insertion of their spinal cord stimulators  and indicated that they would repeat the procedure or repair their spinal cord  stimulator if the need arose.   Our results show many parallels between these two patient groups in terms of  psychological characteristics. Specifically, we found no differences in pain  catastrophising, self-efficacy, or anxiety sensitivity, with both groups demonstrating,  on average, at least moderate ratings on the respective measures (although it is  noteworthy that pain catastrophising scores were approaching clinical significance  among the angina group). We did, however, find some key differences in some  dimensions of health locus of control: analysis revealed significantly higher scores on  the chance and doctors subscales among patients with refractory angina pectoris.  These findings indicate stronger beliefs that health status is predominantly influenced  or determined by particular externality-related factors.  Taken together, these data indicate that the two patient groups shared many  similarities where psychological characteristics are concerned, and the findings  perhaps give some support to the view that refractory angina pectoris lies somewhere  in the spectrum of the chronic pain syndrome and may therefore be amenable (at least  in terms of its psychological sequelae) to integrated psychological-based pain  management interventions.5,6   Research involving patients with angina has shown that maladaptive beliefs about  angina appear to have a negative effect on functional and psychological outcomes.26  Such findings, along with the controversial view that refractory angina pectoris could  be conceptualised as a chronic pain condition, not only challenge assumptions about  conventional clinical pathways for patients with refractory angina pectoris, they also  support the call for considering, as is the case with other chronic pain conditions, the  integration of psychological and educational treatment approaches.27,28  The differences between the groups, where observed, perhaps have some implications  for specific health outcomes, particularly for patients with refractory angina pectoris.  The MHLC provides an assessment of expectancies associated with health status and  health care, and the measure has been demonstrated to be a good predictor of health  behaviours29 and recovery.30 Patients with refractory angina pectoris reported  significantly higher scores on two subscales related to externality, and this raises an  interesting research question of whether these relatively greater externality beliefs  among these patients might be related to poorer health outcomes, as has been shown  in other pain-related conditions.31,32  The pain catastrophising results, although not entirely conclusive, at least raise the  possibility that among patients with refractory angina pectoris there could be a      NZMJ 28 March 2014, Vol 127 No 1391; ISSN 1175 8716  Page 59  URL: http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/127-1391/6051/  ©NZMA       tendency towards maladaptive cognitive and emotional coping responses to pain,  particularly in terms of rumination and feelings of helplessness (e.g., ‘ticking time  bomb’ beliefs). While we remain cautious about overstating any unfounded  implications of these data, we are of the view that they do at least suggest that such  patients would most likely benefit from psychological assessment prior to SCS  implantation, as is typically done in the case of patients with chronic pain conditions.  And while interventions tailored specifically for this group of patients may have  benefits for their symptoms and quality of life,5,6 further research into pain  catastrophising among patients with refractory angina pectoris is needed to warrant its  inclusion as a theme of intervention in any such programme. The same caveat could  also extend to the health locus of control dimensions mentioned above or any other  putatively important psychological characteristics for that matter.  There are some limitations to consider regarding the generalizability of the study  findings, chiefly because, first, the chronic pain group comprised patients across a  number of different conditions and, second, because of the small number of study  participants. Indeed, the small sample size is a major limitation that restricts the extent  to which strong conclusions can be drawn from the data. Nevertheless, it is worth  highlighting that even though the sample of patients was relatively small for both  groups, we were yet able to detect significant differences in a few psychological and  pain-related characteristics. And even though it may well be that there are other  important differences that exist and that the present study was not sufficiently  powered to detect, the differences that were observed may suggest topics of research  involving patients with refractory angina pectoris.  In conclusion, the similar patterns in psychological characteristics give some credence  to the view that refractory angina is a form of chronic pain, and this supports (but also  raises some interesting questions about) psychological-based treatment for these  patients. Therefore, while it is encouraging that studies involving patients with  refractory angina pectoris have reported positively on the effects of psychological- based interventions that are modelled on interventions for chronic pain, the results  from the present study suggest that perhaps such programmes could be enhanced by  addressing some of the unique psychological and pain-related characteristics of these  patients.

There is a paucity of literature describing the clinical presentation and time  periods at which this side effect may present following insertion of cylindrical lead(s). Objective: To describe a series of 5 patients who presented at varying time periods after  SCS lead placement with LFS. Study Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: We performed a chart review of online medical records of patients with  symptoms consistent with LFS at an academic interventional pain clinic identified over 7  consecutive years (2006 - 2013). Results: LFS most frequently presented within months of implantation of cylindrical leads.  One patient complained of LFS during the temporary trial while another developed LFS  after lead revision. All patients were successfully treated when paddle electrodes replaced  percutaneous cylindrical leads. Conclusion: LFS may present as a barrier to successful SCS treatment. Clinicians placing  percutaneous SCS leads should be aware of the variable time course of LFS presentation.  Paddle style electrodes seem to offer an enduring solution to LFS so that patients may  continue to benefit from SCS therapy.

Gill, MD1, and  Thomas T. Simopoulos, MD1 www.painphysicianjournal.com S pinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been utilized  since the late 1960s for chronic, intractable  pain. Percutaneous placement of electrodes  is a minimally invasive procedure that allows for a  therapeutic trial prior to surgical placement of a  permanent cylindrical or paddle style electrode with  an implantable pulse generator (IPG). Since their  introduction in the 1970s, percutaneous cylindrical  electrodes have become the mainstay for trials  and are also commonly employed for permanent  implantation (1). Like paddle style electrodes, SCS  administered through percutaneous leads can render  similar uncomfortable side effects. Specifically, dorsal  root activation in the low thoracic region results in  unpleasant abdominal stimulation. Recruitment of  these fibers is easily appreciated by patients; they  Pain Physician 2014; 17:E397-E403  • ISSN 2150-1149 Pain Physician: May/June 2014; 17:E397-E403 E398   www.painphysicianjournal.com report thoracic radicular sensations, which may progress  to segmental reflex muscle activation as the amplitude  of the stimulation is increased. Because such a side  effect has been commonly recognized to potentially  limit therapy for both styles of electrodes, strategies  such as transverse tripolar stimulation have been put  forth as a solution (2). However, a unique side effect of SCS therapy con- fined to percutaneous leads is inadvertent ligamen- tum flavum stimulation (LFS). LFS, as first described by  North et al (3), is a non-radiating discomfort localized  to the midline and unaccompanied by muscle contrac- tions. It is believed to occur due to recruitment of  small fibers in the ligamentum flavum by the circum- ferential stimulation of cylindrical electrodes. North  et al entirely eliminated this side effect with paddle  style electrodes. They further demonstrated that if the  paddle electrode was inverted, LFS immediately reoc- curred, supporting the argument that the nociceptive  fibers in the ligamentum flavum are activated. Since  the first description by North et al, little has been re- ported regarding the clinical presentation and course  of LFS. We present a case series of 5 patients who  presented with LFS at varied times after percutaneous  cylindrical lead placement. Methods/Case Reports Case 1 A 55-year-old woman volunteered as a donor  partial hepatectomy and underwent a laparotomy. She  had a complicated post-operative course that included  intra-abdominal hematoma, infection, and biliary  leak. She eventually recovered, but developed chronic  neuropathic abdominal wall pain spanning the right  T6 to T9 dermatomes. She was placed on a combina- tion of methadone and gabapentin with modest pain  reduction. Intercostal blocks and cryoablation provided  good but very temporary relief. Psychological assess- ment revealed mild depression but the patient was well  motivated and continued to maintain employment. A  successful trial of SCS was provided for the time course  of 7 days after an 8-contact lead was placed via the  L1/2 interspace and advanced to the top of the T6 ver- tebral level, slightly to the right of visual midline. The  patient then had a permanent system placed with one  8-contact lead and rechargeable IPG (Precision Boston  Scientific, Valencia, CA). The patient had good pain  relief and maintained employment for the next 4 years. She then re-presented with complaints of pain  more towards the right lower quadrant of the abdo- men. Re-evaluation by her gastroenterologist using  endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) failed to  explain the symptoms, and so they were attributed  it to the spread of her neuropathic pain. The patient  was scheduled to have an additional lead in order to  render paresthesia coverage of the right lower quad- rant. During the revision, the original lead at the T6  level was moved to a paraforaminal location to avoid  any unwanted stimulation to the lower extremi- ties (Figs. 1, 2). At no point intraoperatively did the  patient indicate that she experienced stimulation in  the back over the spinous processes. Over the next 2  months she became progressively frustrated because  of the inability to use the SCS device on account of  uncomfortable mid spine stimulation (Fig. 3). Evalua- tion of the leads revealed normal ranged impedances  and reprogramming could not eliminate unwanted  mid-back stimulation. LFS stimulation was suspected  and the patient had the leads replaced with paddle  style electrodes (anterograde lead, Lamitrode 44TM,  retrograde lead Lamitrode Tripole 16cTM, St. Jude  Medical Neuromodulation Division, Plano, TX) (Fig. 4).  After a 2½-year follow-up, she continues to have good  therapeutic results from SCS without LFS. Case 2 A 33-year-old woman with a 2 year history of  chronic right S1 radiculopathy, despite a successful L5/ S1 discectomy, presented with ongoing severe radiat- ing leg pain. She had tried multiple epidural steroid  injections, physical therapy, and was dependent on  sustained morphine release and breakthrough oxyco- done/acetaminophen. After psychological evaluation,  she was offered a trial of SCS. A single 8-contact lead  (Octrode, St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation Division,  Plano, TX) was placed via the T12/L1 interspace and  advanced to the mid T8 vertebral level. She reported  having good pain relief of her axial and radicular  symptoms during a 7 day temporary trial. However, it  was noted from initial activation of the lead as well as  during the trial that she had mid-back discomfort near  the T8-T9 spinous processes. This was minimized with  programming but could not be eliminated. Because of  suspected LFS, a 16-contact paddle and a rechargeable  IPG (Tripole 16C and Eon miniTM, St. Jude Medical  Neuromodulation Division, Plano, TX) were inserted.  At one year post-implant, the patient continues to re- port stimulation in the right lower extremity, without  any uncomfortable mid-back stimulation. www.painphysicianjournal.com   E399 Variable Presentation of Ligamentum Flavum Stimulation with Spinal Cord Stimulator Fig. 1.

Pain Physician: May/June 2014; 17:E397-E403 E400   www.painphysicianjournal.com Case 3 A 45-year-old woman with history of a left lower  extremity crush injury was status post multiple re- constructive surgeries. She had developed complex  regional pain syndrome I and had failed to improve  from conservative management consisting of serial  sympathetic blocks, physical therapy, and poly-pharma- ceuticals, which included sustained release oxycodone,  duloxetine, clonazepam, and tizanidine. Psychological  evaluation did not reveal any conditions that would  preclude a good outcome from SCS therapy. The patient  underwent a trial of SCS with a single percutaneous  8-contact lead (Boston Scientific, Valencia, CA) placed  via L1/L2 and advanced to the top of the T12 vertebral  level in order to ensure capture of the calf and foot. A 5  day temporary trial resulted in marked pain reduction.  She had a permanent system placed consisting of dual  percutaneous 8-contact leads inserted at T12/L1 with  the IPG (Precision Boston Scientific, Valencia, CA) placed  in the right buttock. Excellent paresthesia coverage and  consequent improvement in pain allowed for her to  return to full employment one month after permanent  implantation. Two months post permanent implant, she  presented with a chief complaint of pressure-like pull- ing sensation over the midline at T12-L1. Fluoroscopic  evaluation failed to reveal migration and electrical im- pedances were within normal range. Reprogramming  could not eliminate the dysesthesias in the upper back  region resulting in the patient’s inability to use the SCS  device. Replacement of the leads with a paddle style  electrode (Artisan, Boston Scientific) eliminated LFS and  at 6 month follow-up, the patient reports consistently  good therapeutic response. Case 4 A 46-year-old woman presented with bilateral lum- bosacral radiculopathy that persisted despite L4/5 and  L5/S1 laminectomy and posterior fusion. The patient  had tried multiple courses of physical and injection- based therapies without success. She had been tried on  multiple medications and continued on a combination  of metaxalone, gabapentin, and hydrocodone/acet- aminophen. Following a favorable psychological evalu- ation, the patient underwent a temporary single 8-con- tact lead (Octrode, St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation  Division, Plano, TX) placement via the T12/L1 interspace  and advanced to the inferior endplate of the T8 verte- bral body. She experienced 100% relief of her radicular  pain and 50% relief of low back pain symptoms. Per- manent SCS implant consisted of dual 8-contact leads at  the same level as the trial with a rechargeable IPG (Eon  mini, Saint Jude Medical) placed in the left buttocks.  At her 2 month follow-up visit, the patient reported an  85% overall reduction in pain intensity and was very  satisfied with the therapy. At 4 months after implantation, she complained of  pain in her upper back with device activation and LFS was  suspected. Over the next 2 months, this pain became pro- gressive to the point where she could no longer use the  device. Investigation of the device revealed no migration  as well as no electrical impedance changes. Reprogram- ming of the stimulating contacts could not establish the  necessary paresthesia coverage without suspected LFS. A  paddle lead (Penta, St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation  Division, Plano, TX) was used to replace the cylindrical  leads and at 6 months follow-up, she had no reports of  uncomfortable mid-back stimulation.

Antero-posterior fluoroscopic image of  anterograde  and retrograde paddles at the T6 and T8 levels. www.painphysicianjournal.com   E401 Variable Presentation of Ligamentum Flavum Stimulation with Spinal Cord Stimulator Case 5 A 61-year-old man presented with bilateral leg  pain consistent with lumbosacral radiculopathy, which  developed after a work-related injury. He had received  a laminectomy with subsequent magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) studies revealing only modest forami- nal stenosis at the lower lumbar levels. He failed to  improve with serial epidural steroid injections, physi- cal therapy, and multimodal analgesia that included  hydrocodone, duloxetine, and pregabalin. After a  favorable psychological evaluation, placement of a  percutaneous SCS 8-contact trial lead (Octrode, St. Jude  Medical Neuromodulation Division, Plano, TX) at the  superior endplate of T8 achieved 50% pain reduction  in the lower extremities. Subsequently, he underwent  permanent implantation of dual 8-contact leads at the  T8 level with a rechargeable IPG (EON, St. Jude Medi- cal Neuromodulation Division, Plano, TX) placed in the  right buttock. He initially developed LFS immediately after place- ment, which resolved with re-programming resulting  in marked alleviation of his sciatic pain. Specifically,  cathodes of the second lead immediately to the left  of the midline lead could no longer be used because  they seemed to be the cause of LFS. Two years and 3  months after permanent SCS placement, he again de- veloped axial stimulation related pain at the T9 level  of the stimulating electrode. The patient reported that  the stimulation in the upper back intensified over the  course of one month to the point where he could no  longer use the SCS device despite previously achieving  good relief of his radicular symptoms. The leads were  checked for electrical integrity, and no impendence ab- normalities were found. Reprogramming of the device  at this point could not establish paresthesia coverage  without LFS. LFS resolved after a paddle style electrode  (Penta, St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation Division,  Plano, TX) was placed. At 2-year follow-up, the patient  reported stable therapeutic paresthesia coverage of his  lower extremities and no LFS. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first case series de- scribing LFS beyond the trial stage and the varying time  intervals at which LFS may present after percutaneous  cylindrical lead placement. North et al (3) described LFS  only in the trial phase of SCS with percutaneous cylin- drical leads. LFS seems to be able to develop months  to years after successful implantation and may even  manifest following revision of a lead in someone who  previously did not describe symptoms of LFS. When  LFS does occur, it progressively disrupts therapy so  that patients have little choice but to cease using the  device. Although stimulation amplitudes were not re- corded in these cases, patients could no longer use the  amplitudes that render comfortable and effective par- esthesias over the corresponding painful regions (e.g.  back and legs). This was because the therapeutic level  of amplitude caused significant pain localized over the  stimulating portion of the lead. For patients present- ing with restricted mid- or near mid-back pain at the  level of the active stimulating contacts corresponding  to the spinous processes, LFS should be considered as a  potential cause regardless of time from lead placement  (Fig. 3). The pain over the spinous process occurred only  with the device on and was far above the lead anchors  and site(s) of insertion. The physical exam did not re- veal any point tenderness over the thoracic paraspinal  muscles or spinous processes. Finally, LFS can occur with  the electrode in a paraforaminal location (Case 1, Figs.  1, 2) or in a classic midline or just off midline for dorsal  column stimulation (Cases 2 – 5). Although the incidence of LFS is not established  in the literature, it is felt to be a relatively uncommon  side effect of SCS. This may relate to the fact that the  innervation of the ligamentum flavum has been shown  to be poor (4-8). The ligamentum flavum has no known  painful pathological lesions, and the high elastin con- tent gives it great dispensability for resisting injury (9).  Nonetheless, some patients may have small nociceptive  fibers on the anterior surface of the ligamentum flavum  that may become activated by cylindrical electrodes.  One study supports the possibility that the human  ligamentum flavum is capable of nociception by dem- onstrating the presence of sodium channel subtypes ex- pressed in nociceptors (10). Over time, fibrosis is known  to develop over stimulating contacts and impedances  between contacts are known to vary over the time (11).  This effect commonly requires higher amplitudes on the  cathode(s) in order to achieve therapeutic paresthesia.  Higher levels of stimulating cathodic energy may also  inadvertently be distributed to small fibers innervating  the ligamentum flavum. Consequently, LFS may be seen  months to years after implantation. It may also develop  in the context of lead revision if the new lead is placed  over a firm, fibrotic scar that results in it being posi- tioned closer to the ligamentum flavum. Alternatively,  there is a theoretical possibility that some patients  may develop nerve ingrowth following the insertions  of leads into the epidural space. While nerve ingrowth  Pain Physician: May/June 2014; 17:E397-E403 E402   www.painphysicianjournal.com has not been demonstrated to occur at the level of  the ligamentum flavum, it is well known to occur in  other spinal structures, such as in the intervertebral disc  (12,13).  An important consideration in this case series is  that LFS as a diagnosis is speculative. There was no  Fig. 5. A) T2 weighted MRI of  lumbar spine, axial view. Diagram of  percutaneous cylindrical spinal cord stimulator in epidural  space. B) Diagram of  insulated paddle style electrode placement in similar space. A B confirmatory measurement of the neuronal activa- tion in any of the immediate posterior epidural space  structures following a stimulation pulse. However, a  reasonable argument supporting preferable stimula- tion of the ligamentum flavum can be made on the  basis of electrode proximity and tissue resistivity. Fig.  www.painphysicianjournal.com   E403 Variable Presentation of Ligamentum Flavum Stimulation with Spinal Cord Stimulator 5 demonstrates both a cylindrical and paddle lead with  proximal anatomic structures that primarily includes  the ligamentum flavum, lamina, and very laterally, the  facet joints. The resistivity of connective tissue proteins,  such as collagen and elastin that comprise the dura  mater and ligamentum flavum is relatively low when  compared to bone (14). Vertebral bone has a resistivity  of 50,000 Ohms∙mm compared to only 1,666 Ohms∙mm  for the dura mater (15). The current will flow in the  path of the lowest resistance during a stimulation  pulse to affect neurons in connective tissue such as the  ligamentum flavum. Further conduction to the interspi- nous ligament is also possible and cannot be entirely  excluded clinically as the stimulation reported by pa- tients is midline. The paraspinal muscles are unlikely to  be involved given both the off midline anatomic loca- tion as well as the lack of clinically apparent spasm.         A practical solution for patients in all cases was to  replace percutaneous cylindrical leads with paddle style  electrodes. Interestingly, even with more programming  options available in 16-contact, multichannel systems  compared to 4-contact cylindrical leads used over the  prior 15 years, therapeutic paresthesia coverage could  not be re-established. This side effect of SCS did not  vary amongst manufactures given that all percutaneous  electrode designs are similar in their cylindrical omni- directional characteristic. Paddle electrodes are always  insulated on the dorsal surface regardless of the manu- facturer. The dorsal surface of the paddle adequately  insulates the stimulating contact(s), and thus does not  permit electrical activation of structures posterior to  the dura as demonstrated by North et al (3). Enduring  pain relief was therefore possible using this style of  lead design, provided LFS was diagnosed and the leads  were appropriately revised.   conclusion  LFS is a possible barrier for successful SCS therapy,  and may present with a variable time course after the  insertion of a cylindrical percutaneous electrode. This  type of stimulation presents as a progressive, midline  discomfort during active stimulation that eventually  results in the loss of the ability to utilize SCS therapy.  Replacement of percutaneous cylindrical leads with  paddle style electrodes is typically a successful recovery  option for eliminating LFS and restoring the benefit of  SCS therapy. RefeRences 1.

Abstract Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of paresthesia-free high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (HF10 SCS) for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain of the low back and legs. Design. Prospective, multicenter, observational study. Method. Patients with signiﬁcant chronic low back pain underwent implantation of a spinal cord stimulator capable of HF10 SCS. Patients’ pain ratings, disability, sleep disturbances, opioid use, satisfaction, and adverse events were assessed for 24 months. Results. After a trial period, 88% (72 of 82) of patients reported a signiﬁcant improvement in pain scores and underwent the permanent implan- tation of the system. Ninety percent (65 of 72) of patients attended a 24-month follow-up visit. Mean back pain was reduced from 8.4 ± 0.1 at baseline to 3.3 ± 0.3 at 24 months (P < 0.001), and mean leg pain from 5.4 ± 0.4 to 2.3 ± 0.3 (P < 0.001). Con- comitantly to the pain relief, there were signi- ﬁcant decreases in opioid use, Oswestry Disability Index score, and sleep disturbances. Patients’ satisfaction and recommendation ratings were high. Adverse Events were similar in type and fre- quency to those observed with traditional SCS systems. Conclusions. In patients with chronic low back pain, HF10 SCS resulted in clinically signiﬁcant and sustained back and leg pain relief, functional and sleep improvements, opioid use reduction, and high patient satisfaction. These results support the long-term safety and sustained efficacy of HF10 SCS. Key Words. Spinal Cord Stimulation; High- Frequency Stimulation; Chronic Low Back Pain; Failed Back Surgery Syndrome Introduction Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an accepted treatment for failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS)—the presence of persistent or recurrent back and/or leg pain following spinal surgery [1]. Published rates of FBSS following spinal surgery range from 10% to 40% [2]. These patients present a large disease burden to industrialized societies bs_bs_banner Pain Medicine 2014; 15: 347–354 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 347 © 2013 The Authors.

In landmark studies of FBSS patients, North et al. found SCS to be superior to reoperation, and Kumar et al. found SCS to be superior to conventional medical man- agement [4,5]. However, these studies excluded patients in whom low back pain was the predominant symptom. It is long established that relieving low back pain with tradi- tional SCS is much more challenging than relieving radicu- lar leg pain [6,7]. In addition to the large number of patients with residual, disabling low back pain after spinal surgery, low back pain in patients without prior surgical interventions from degenerative etiologies present a great disease burden to industrialized societies [8]. High-frequency spinal cord stimulation (HF10 SCS) therapy is a form of SCS that delivers high frequency stimulation to the spinal cord by a system of leads and implantable pulse generator (IPG) that resembles standard systems. Our group previously published the 6-month results from a prospective, multicenter trial of HF10 SCS for chronic low back pain [9]. Marked reductions in both back and leg pain, and associated improvements in quality of life measures were shown. These 6-month results were very promising, but it is desirable to evaluate any new SCS modality over a longer term because it is known that the efﬁcacy of traditional low-frequency SCS may diminish with time [5,10]. Here we report the 24-month follow-up of efﬁcacy, patient satisfaction, and safety data from these same patients. Methods The study was conducted at two European centers (AZ Nikolaas Pain Centre, St Niklaas Belgium and Guy’s and St Thomas’ Pain and Neuromodulation Centre, London, United Kingdom). Both centers obtained ethics commit- tee approvals, and all patients provided informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with local clinical research and data protection regulations, good clinical practice guidelines (ISO 14155), and the Declaration of Helsinki. Device Description The rechargeable Senza® SCS system (Nevro Corp., Menlo Park, CA, USA) received European regulatory approval (CE Mark) in May 2010 for use in the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs. Similar to other commercially available SCS systems in design, this SCS system delivers electrical stimulation to the spinal cord via a pulse generator and epidural leads. However, unlike traditional systems, this HF10 SCS system is capable of delivering stimulation frequencies up to 10 kHz. At this frequency, the resulting stimulation is paresthesia-free. Study Design and Patient Selection For this prospective, multicenter, open-label study, patients had to meet the following criteria: be candidate for commercial SCS device (have failed to respond to at least 6 months of conventional treatment including phar- macological treatment, physical therapy, epidural injec- tions, and/or radiofrequency therapy) [1], have a primary diagnosis of chronic back pain (deﬁned as lumbo-sacral pain) with or without leg pain with intensity of at least 5.0 out of 10.0 (average score over the last 30 days) on the visual analog scale (VAS), be able to provide consent, be 18 years or older at the time of enrollment, and be able to comply with study procedures, visits, and assessments. Patients were excluded from the study if they had obvious mechanical instability related to pain (diagnosed by imaging taken within the past 12 months), have malignan- cies, have a life expectancy of less than 1 year, have a systematic infection, have any active implanted device whether turned off or on, are already participating in another clinical study, are pregnant/lactating or not using adequate birth control, have untreated major psychiatric comorbidity, serious drug-related behavior issues, have bleeding complications or coagulopathy issues, are immunocompromised patients at risk for infection or other issues, and are insulin-dependent diabetic who is not controlled through diet and/or medication (Table 1). Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion Criteria To participate in the study, patient must have met all of the following criteria: • Be candidate for commercial SCS device (have failed to respond to at least 6 months of conventional treatment including pharmacological treatment, physical therapy, epidural injections and/or radiofrequency therapy) • Have a primary diagnosis of chronic back pain (deﬁned as lumbo-sacral pain) with or without leg pain with intensity of at least 5.0 out of 10.0 (average score over the last 30 days) on the VAS • Be able to provide consent • Be 18 years or older at the time of enrollment • Be able to comply with study procedures, visits, and assessments. Exclusion Criteria Patient were excluded from study participation if they met any of the following criteria: • Had obvious mechanical instability related to pain (diagnosed by imaging taken within the past 12 months) • Have malignancies, have a life expectancy of less than 1 year • Have a systematic infection, have any active implanted device whether turned off or on • Are already participating in another clinical study • Are pregnant/lactating or not using adequate birth control • Have untreated major psychiatric comorbidity, serious drug related behavior issues • Have bleeding complications or coagulopathy issues • Are immunocompromised patients at risk for infection or other issues • Are insulin-dependent diabetic who is not controlled through diet and/or medication 348 © 2013 The Authors. Pain Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Al-Kaisy et al. After baseline evaluation, patients underwent a percuta- neous trial for 14–30 days based on the center’s standard practice. An external trial stimulator delivered bipolar stimulation at 10 kHz and current amplitude in the range of 1–5 mA. A programming algorithm deﬁned during a previous study was used to optimize the HF10 SCS stimu- lation according to each patient’s report of pain relief [11]. A trial was considered successful if there was 50% or more reduction in pain intensity. After a successful trial, an IPG was implanted. Patients were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following permanent implant. Changes in pain medications based on clinical judgment and adjustment of stimulation param- eters were permitted throughout the follow-up period. Also, patients were allowed to adjust the amplitude of the therapy, within a predeﬁned range, using a patient remote control. Procedures The trial and permanent implantation procedures were based on each center’s established method for conven- tional SCS. The HF10 SCS surgical procedures differed from that used for traditional stimulation in three key ways: 1) the two leads were sited solely anatomically—in the midline spanning T8 to T11 (Figure 1); 2) concordant par- esthesia mapping was not performed at any time; and 3) there is no need to lighten sedation for paresthesia testing. Data Collection and Statistical Analysis Baseline and follow-up data included VAS ratings for back and leg pain, sleep disturbance as assessed by the subjective number of awakenings per night, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and neurological examinations. Additionally, patients used a 5-point scale to rate their satisfaction with their therapy and whether they would recommend it to others. The study personnel at each center directed the administration/collection of the data. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each analyzed variable. These include the number of observations, mean, median, and standard deviation. Two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze continuous variables, such as VAS. Adverse events (AEs) are reported descriptively for all patients. A P value less than or equal to 5% (P < 0.05) was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. Results Of the 83 patients enrolled, 82 completed the trial phase and 72 of them had a successful trial of the HF10 SCS system and proceeded to implantation of an IPG (one patient withdrew from the study during the trial phase). Sixty-ﬁve of the 72 patients (90%) were available for data collection at 24 months (Figure 2): four patients did not consent to continued data collection beyond the 6-month follow-up of the original study, two were explanted due to suboptimal pain relief, and one patient was withdrawn from the study by an investigating physician because the patient developed painful pelvic pathology which inter- fered with the study. Baseline patient characteristics are presented in Table 2. There are no statistical differences between the baseline characteristics of the patients trialed successfully and those followed up for 24 months. At 24 months, the mean reported VAS score for back pain was 3.3 ± 0.3, compared with 8.4 ± 0.1 at baseline and 2.7 ± 0.3 at 6 months. Back pain relief was signiﬁcant and sustained to 24 months (P < 0.001 when 24 month VAS was compared with baseline). Mean leg pain VAS score Figure 1 X-ray of leads spanning T8 to T11. Figure 2 Disposition of study patients. 349 © 2013 The Authors. Pain Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. High-Frequency SCS for Chronic Back Pain was 2.3 ± 0.3 at 24 months, compared with 5.4 ± 0.4 at baseline and 1.4 ± 0.3 at 6 months (Figure 3). Leg pain relief was also signiﬁcant and sustained to 24 months (P < 0.001 when 24 month VAS was compared with base- line). At 24 months, 60% of the implanted patients had at least 50% back pain relief and 71% had at least 50% leg pain relief. ODI and sleep disturbances at 24 months post-IPG implant were signiﬁcantly lower compared with baseline. Mean ODI values decreased from 55 ± 1 at base- line to 40 ± 2 at 24 months (P < 0.001). Mean subjective sleep disturbances per night decreased from 3.7 ± 0.4 at baseline to 1.4 ± 0.2 at 24 month follow-up (P < 0.001). Eighty-six percent of patients were taking some form of opioid at baseline, and this reduced to 57% at 24 months (P < 0.001). The mean dosage of oral morphine equiva- lents per patient decreased from 84 mg/day at baseline to 27 mg/day at 24 months (P < 0.001). Eighty-one percent of patients reported they were satis- ﬁed or very satisﬁed with the HF10 SCS system, and 88% of them would recommend or highly recommend it to others with similar pain. A summary of the serious device-related AEs is provided in Table 3. The most commonly occurring AEs were pocket pain and lead migration. The reported AEs were similar in nature and frequency to those seen with tradi- tional SCS systems [5]. After 24 months of HF10 SCS, no patient had any evidence of neurologic deﬁcit or dysfunc- tion that could be attributed to the prolonged delivery of HF10 SCS therapy.

Discussion Our group previously reported the 6-month results from a prospective, multicenter trial of HF10 SCS for chronic intractable back pain, which demonstrated very signiﬁcant reductions in back pain as well as leg pain and associated improvements in quality of life measures [9]. This study shows the long-term improvements in back pain, leg pain, functional capacity, opioid use, and sleep in these patients treated with HF10 SCS. Strengths of the study include a sizeable study group (82 patients trialed and 72 of receiving permanent HF10 SCS implant) and a very high follow-up percentage of 90% (65 of 72) at 24 months. After 24 months of HF10 SCS, 60% of patients reported reductions from baseline back pain of greater than 50%, and 71% of patients reported reductions in leg pain of more than 50%. Published 24-month data with traditional SCS is available in the Prospective Randomized Con- trolled Multicenter Trial of the Effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation (PROCESS) and North et al. studies [4,5] and is presented in Table 4. In the PROCESS study, 40% of 42 patients had at least 50% leg pain relief at 24 months, and there was associated improved function and quality of life. North et al. reported the results on 19 FBSS patients with predominant leg pain at a mean follow-up of 2.9 years: SCS was successful (deﬁned as >50% VAS reduction) in 47% of the patients available at ﬁnal follow-up. The results seen in this HF10 SCS study compare favorably with these traditional stimulation results, especially when one considers that the HF10 SCS cohort consisted of the difﬁcult to treat primary axial back pain population that was excluded from the PROCESS and North studies. This trial also included a signiﬁcant number of patients (19%) who had not undergone previous spine surgery, a notori- ously difﬁcult to treat population [12]. In fact, in the SCS randomized population of the PROCESS trial, no signiﬁ- cant change was seen at 24 months in back pain. Furthermore, the North and PROCESS studies did not demonstrate a signiﬁcant reduction in opioid use, whereas in this HF10 SCS group, pain reduction was accompanied by concomitant reductions in opioid use and dosage. Thirty-eight percent of patients stopped taking opioids during follow-up, and the mean dosage of morphine per patient decreased from 84 mg at baseline down to 27 mg at 24 months. This study shows that the pain relief afforded by HF10 SCS is maintained for at least 24 months. The mean VAS baseline back pain score of 8.4 ± 0.1 was markedly reduced at 24 months with a score of 3.3 ± 0.3, and the small increase from a back pain score of 2.7 ± 0.3 at 6 months of therapy was not statistically signiﬁcant. Simi- larly, the relief in leg pain was well maintained at 24 months with the baseline score of 5.4 ± 0.4 reduced to 2.3 ± 0.3 at 24 months. The rise in leg pain score between 6-month therapy and 24-month therapy (1.4 ± 0.3 to 2.3 ± 0.3) was statistically signiﬁcant, but was small compared with Table 4 SCS studies with 24-month results for back and leg pain Study Predominant Pain Area Trial Success # of pts, %) No. of pts at 24 month Leg Pain Back Pain Function Opioids (VAS Score, Responders) (VAS Score, Responders) (ODI Score) (Pts on Opioids, mg/day) Baseline 6 month 12 month 24 month Baseline 6 month 12 month 24 month Baseline 24 month Baseline 24 month HF10 SCS Back 72/82 pts 88% 65 5.4 1.5† 2.0† 2.3† 8.4 2.7† 2.8† 3.3† 55 40† 86% 57%† — 86% 65% 71% — 74% 70% 60% — — 84 27† North et al.

Pain Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. High-Frequency SCS for Chronic Back Pain the reduction from baseline. This observation is not unusual, considering that the beneﬁts of traditional SCS will also diminish with time. This is exempliﬁed in the landmark work by Kemler et al., reporting reduction in the efﬁcacy of SCS in complex regional pain syndrome over time [10]. The possible reasons for this diminution are myriad but may include progression of disease, patients reframing their pain, changes in neuroplasticity, and elec- trode tip ﬁbrosis [5]. It is therefore crucial to report long- term results when evaluating new SCS technologies. The improvement in ODI at 24 months is both statistically and clinically signiﬁcant, with a baseline ODI of 55 ± 1 reduced to 40 ± 2 at 24 months. The improvement in patient function is illustrated in Figure 4, showing 90% of patients were classiﬁed as crippled or severely disabled at baseline, and this reduced to 49% at 24 months. Our study cohort includes two main subgroups who warrant individual discussion (Figure 5). Sixty-seven of the 83 patients (81%) in this study were FBSS patients, while 16 patients (19%) had no past history of surgery. In the FBSS group, 57 (79%) had a successful trial and received a permanent implant. Baseline mean back pain VAS was 8.5 ± 0.2 in this group, and this dropped to 2.7 ± 0.4 at 6 months (P < 0.001) and was 3.2 ± 0.4 at 24 months (P < 0.001). FBSS group’s mean baseline leg pain VAS was 5.3 ± 0.4, and this dropped to 1.5 ± 0.4 at 6 months (P < 0.001) and was 2.1 ± 0.3 at 24 months (P < 0.001). In the group without prior back surgery, patients with predominantly degenerative disc disease, 15 of the 16 patients had a successful trial (94% successful trial rate). The mean VAS back pain at baseline was 8.1 ± 0.2, which was reduced to 2.6 ± 0.7 at 6 months (P < 0.001) and 3.4 ± 0.7 at 24 months (P < 0.001). The mean VAS leg pain score in this group was 5.9 ± 0.8 at baseline, 1.2 ± 0.6 at 6 months (P < 0.001), and 2.8 ± 0.7 at 24 months (P < 0.05). The positive 24-month results in this group of patients indicate that HF10 SCS may be an effective treatment for many patients with severe chronic back pain in whom surgery is not indicated. Further studies are warranted in this group to demonstrate effec- tiveness deﬁnitively. Another group of special interest in this study population is patients who have previously failed traditional SCS (N = 14). These patients had either failed an SCS trial due to the lack of back paresthesia coverage (N = 10), or failed after permanent IPG implant due to the loss of back pain relief. Eleven (79%) of these patients had a successful trial. Baseline mean VAS back pain score was 8.9 ± 0.3, reduced to 2.0 ± 0.6 at 6 months (P < 0.001) and 4.2 ± 0.9 at 24 months (P < 0.05). Mean leg pain VAS was 7.7 ± 0.8 at baseline, 1.9 ± 0.9 at 6 months (P < 0.05), and 2.5 ± 0.6 at 24 months (P < 0.05). The success of HF10 SCS at 24 months in this population who had failed traditional SCS suggests that spinal stimulation might still be a useful therapy if HF10 SCS is employed. This is particularly important for the many patients with current SCS systems that are not getting optimal results. The safety proﬁle of HF10 SCS at 24 months is reassuring. IPG pocket pain and lead migrations were the most common AEs, as seen with traditional SCS [5]. None of the implanted IPGs had to be explanted due to a technical issue. No AEs directly related to the stimulation effects were observed. At 24 months, more than 80% of the patients were satis- ﬁed or very satisﬁed with their therapy, and close to 90% of them would recommend it to other patients, percent- ages similar to those reported at 6 months. This is a very high satisfaction rate, similar to that observed by Kumar et al. in a population patients implanted with Figure 4 Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)— Distribution of patient disability levels. 64% 17% 19% FBSS FBSS - Failed SCS  Back Pain w/o prior surgery Figure 5 Distribution of patients back pain diagnoses. 352 © 2013 The Authors. Pain Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Al-Kaisy et al. a non-rechargeable SCS device, and it suggests that the charging requirements of the HF10 SCS system are well- tolerated by patients. Another key factor that may explain the high patient sat- isfaction is that HF10 SCS is the lack of paresthesia. Many patients with traditional SCS ﬁnd paresthesia unpleasant, and surges of stimulation with position changes can also cause problems [13]. No need for intraoperative paresthe- sia mapping also simpliﬁes the procedure for the implant- ing physician. The difﬁcult-to-treat patient population with predomi- nantly chronic back pain has been the focus of various studies using additional stimulation techniques such as peripheral ﬁeld stimulation, triangular stimulation, and tripolar surgical leads [14–16]—all of these techniques involve attempts to produce paresthesia in the low back and involve the placement of additional leads. To date, no long-term results with these techniques have been published that match the results seen in this HF10 SCS study. Subsequent to the publication of the 6-month results of this HF10 SCS study population [9], a trial using 5 kHz SCS for back pain (in patients already being treated successfully with traditional stimulation) has been published [17]. The authors recognized that this 5 kHz study had design ﬂaws, but they concluded that 5 kHz stimulation was no different than sham. The success that we have observed with HF10 SCS in contrast to the 5 kHz stimulation may be due to different frequencies used (10 kHz vs 5 kHz) but also may be due to key study design elements such as using low-frequency paresthesia coverage to identify areas of stimula- tion at 5 kHz, or evaluating subjects who are accus- tomed to paresthesia and associate this sensation with pain relief. The main limitation of this study lies in its observational design with the lack of a control group. However, the methodology and execution of this study (large sample size, multicenter, long duration, and low dropout rate) reduce the chance of overestimating the magnitude of the treatment effect [18]. The prolonged duration of the study and relatively small diminution in treatment effect suggest against a placebo effect. Conclusion In this study, patients with chronic low back pain have shown a marked and sustained response to HF10 SCS treatment. After 24 months of treatment, both back pain and leg pains were signiﬁcantly reduced. Patient function, opioid utilization, and sleep were markedly improved. No AEs related to the high-frequency stimulation itself were observed. The positive results of this large prospective trial are encouraging and should inspire further investigation of the role that HF10 SCS may play in treating chronic spinal pain and other chronic pain states.

Brown, FRCP SPINAL CORD STIMULATION FAILED TO RELIEVE AKINESIA OR RESTORE LOCOMOTION IN PARKINSON DISEASE Dorsal column spinal stimulation in dopamine- depleted rodents was recently reported to disrupt pathologic corticostriatal synchronization, alleviate akinesia, and restore locomotion.1 This claim has prompted consideration that spinal stimulation “might become an efficient and less invasive alterna- tive for treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) in the future.” In this study, we investigated whether dorsal col- umn stimulation was of therapeutic benefit in 2 pa- tients with PD. Level of evidence. This study provides Class II evi- dence that for patients with moderate to severe mo- tor impairment from PD, high-frequency epidural cervical spinal cord stimulation does not significantly improve motor function as measured by the motor subsection of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Methods. Two patients with PD had spinal stimula- tors (Medtronic models 3487a or 3898) implanted surgically into the high cervical epidural space with- out complication, as described previously.2 Patient 1, 75 years old, had moderate motor impairment (off/on medication motor UPDRS � 30/18). Pa- tient 2, 77 years old, had more severe motor im- pairment (off/on medication UPDRS � 51/38) and was unable to walk without dopaminergic medication. Both patients met UK Brain Bank cri- teria for PD.3 Ten days postoperatively, both patients partici- pated in a double-blind crossover study of the motor effects of spinal stimulation. In an initial exploratory phase, an antiparkinsonian effect of spinal stimula- tion was sought over a range of frequencies (30–300 Hz) and intensities (up to 4.0 V and 240 �s). Having failed to establish a clear benefit for any particular set of parameters, for the purposes of the study, patient 1 was assigned to receive 130 Hz stimulation (a com- mon frequency employed for deep brain stimulation and beneficial in the rodent study) and patient 2 300 Hz (the most effective frequency in the rodent study). At those frequencies, stimulation intensity thresholds for the production of paresthesiae were established. Patients were then assessed in the off medication state (after overnight withdrawal of do- paminergic medication) during 3 conditions: off stimulation, subthreshold stimulation (without paresthesiae), and suprathreshold stimulation (with paresthesiae). Subthreshold and suprath- reshold stimulation parameters were as follows: pa- tient 1 130 Hz/2 V/240 �s and 130 Hz/3 V/240 �s; patient 2 300 Hz/3 V/200 �s and 300 Hz/4 V/200 �s. The ordering of conditions was counterbalanced so that each patient had 9 assessments. Outcomes were assessed �20 minutes after switching stimula- tion conditions (a period sufficient for most parkin- sonian signs to return following subthalamic stimulation).4 The primary outcome measure was the motor subsection of the UPDRS (motor UPDRS, mean score of 2 blinded neurologists rating from vid- eotape).5 Secondary outcomes included the timed Hand-Arm Movement test (number of alternating movements between 2 fixed points 30 cm apart in 30 s, mean of both sides), timed foot tapping score (number of foot taps in 30 s, mean of both sides), and time to walk 10 m test.6 Paresthesiae were rated by the subjects with a Visual Analogue Scale (10 cm VAS).7 Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. Ethical approval was granted by the local ethics committee and patients gave written informed consent. Results. Startle was not observed with changes to stimulation in either patient. VAS scores for the su- prathreshold condition were greater than the off stimulation condition (mean 2.1 vs 0.68 cm, Z � �2.03, p � 0.04 Wilcoxon). VAS scores for the sub- threshold and off stimulation conditions were not different (1.9 vs 0.68 cm, Z � �0.94, p � 0.35 Wilcoxon). There was strong interrater reliability be- tween the motor UPDRS scoring of the 2 blinded neurologists (Spearman rho � 0.92). There was no difference in the primary outcome measure of motor UPDRS between stimulation con- ditions (�2 � 1.65, p � 0.44 Friedman). There were Neurology 74 April 20, 2010 1325 no differences in any other outcome measure with stimulation (table). Dorsal column stimulation did not restore the locomotion of patient 2, who re- mained unable to walk in the off medication state. Discussion. We assessed whether the benefits of spinal stimulation, recently reported in parkinso- nian rodents, could be translated to patients with PD. While it is not possible to prove that spinal stimulation in some form will never be of thera- peutic value, we found that in 2 subjects, dorsal column stimulation delivered continuously at clinically acceptable stimulation intensities was not clinically beneficial. The difference in outcomes between the 2 studies may reflect differences between species, models, or, alternatively, the differing methods of stimulation. In the rodent study, suprathreshold stimulation at intensities sufficient to produce startle was applied intermittently in 30–60 s bursts.1 Only during and shortly after stimulation did beneficial effects occur, which included reduced beta oscillations, alleviation of akinesia, and increased locomotion. The authors postulated that dorsal column stimulation may di- rectly desynchronize pathologic oscillations, thereby providing a state permissive for movement. However, an alternative mechanism is simply that bursts of startling stimulation increased arousal, thereby precipitating movement, as occurs with par- adoxical kinesis. The authors of the rodent study controlled for startle-related phenomena by applying startling trigeminal stimulation, but at lower inten- sity thresholds than applied for spinal stimulation. Locomotion not only increased in parkinsonian ro- dents, but in healthy control rodents as well. Cru- cially, the effect of chronic stimulation was not reported so it is possible that habituation may have occurred. Intermittent startling spinal stimulation that briefly precipitates locomotion by increasing arousal would not be an acceptable therapy in patients. However, we found that spinal stimulation admi- nistered continuously, at the same frequencies and at clinically acceptable intensities, failed to improve motor deficits in 2 carefully evaluated patients with PD. *These authors contributed equally.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a novel type of SCS  therapy designed to automatically adapt stimulation amplitude in response to changes in a patient’s position or  activity. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that automatic position-adaptive SCS benefited  patients in terms of pain relief and/or convenience compared with neurostimulation adjusted with conventional  manual programming. Secondary objectives included assessment of worsened pain relief with automatic  adjustment; change in pain score; and the number of manual programming adjustments with position-adaptive  neurostimulation compared with manual programming. Study Design: Prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized crossover study. Setting: Ten interventional pain management centers in the US. Methods: Patients were enrolled a minimum of one week after a successful SCS screening trial. They were  then implanted with the RestoreSensorTM neurostimulation device (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) that could  be programmed to either automatic position-adaptive stimulation (AdaptiveStimTM) or manual adjustment of  stimulation parameters. After implant, all devices were programmed to conventional manual adjustment for a  4-week postoperative period. The patients were then randomized to either conventional manual programming  adjustment or position-adaptive stimulation with crossover to the opposite treatment arm occurring at 6 weeks  after randomization. The patients were followed for another 6 weeks after crossover.  This study was conducted  under an FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and approval of the responsible Institutional Review  Boards (IRBs) of the study centers. Results: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the study. In an intent-to-treat analysis, 86.5% of patients achieved  the primary objective of improved pain relief with no loss of convenience or improved convenience with no loss of  pain relief using automatic position-adaptive stimulation compared with using conventional manual programming  adjustment alone. This was statistically significantly greater than the predefined minimum success rate of 25%,   P < 0.001 (exact one-sided 97.5% lower confidence limit was 76.5%). Only 2.8% of patients reported worsened pain  relief during position-adaptive stimulation compared with manual programming. There was a statistically significant  reduction in the mean numeric pain rating scale score compared with baseline scores in both treatment arms.  Additionally, position-adaptive stimulation demonstrated a statistically significant 41% reduction in the daily average  number of programming button presses for amplitude adjustment compared with manual programming (18.2 per  day versus 30.7 per day, P = 0.002). Functional improvements reported with position-adaptive stimulation included:  improved comfort during position changes (80.3%); improved activity (69%); and improved sleep (47.9%). Adverse  events associated with uncomfortable sensations from stimulation did not differ significantly between treatment  arms. The incidence of device-related serious adverse events was 3.9%. Limitations: Patients and physicians were not blinded to whether devices were programmed to automatic  position-adaptive stimulation or manual adjustment. Responses to assessment questionnaires were based on  patient recall.  Conclusions: The study demonstrated that automatic position-adaptive stimulation is safe and effective in  providing benefits in terms of patient-reported improved pain relief and convenience compared with using manual  programming adjustment alone.

In the  supine position, the DCSF layer was 2.0 to 6.0 mm at  T-11 and 1.5 to 4.5 mm at T-12 (13,14). In the prone po- sition, the thickness of the DCSF layer increased by ap- proximately 2.2 mm at T-11 and 3.4 mm at T-12 (13,14).  Position-related changes in the DCSF layer will result  in either a decrease or an increase in the distance be- tween an epidural neurostimulation lead and the spinal  cord, which may in turn result in over- or understimula- tion, respectively.  Consequently, the strength of stimulation needed  to achieve optimal paresthesia intensity can be highly  variable with position changes. Understimulation can  result in less than adequate pain relief, while overstim- ulation can result in mild to intense discomfort. These  differences have been noted and studied by physicians  for many years. Olin et al (12) demonstrated that the  perceptual threshold of stimulation paresthesia was di- rectly related to body position. Specifically, thresholds  for the sitting and standing positions were found to be  significantly higher than for the supine position for the  majority of patients. This work was confirmed by Abe- jon and Feler (13) who subsequently demonstrated sig- nificant differences in the energy required to achieve  comfortable paresthesia for standing, sitting down, ly- ing down, and walking. Thus, variability in stimulation  delivered at the target neural fibers would be expect- ed to impact the overall effectiveness of SCS therapy  (12,13,21,22).  To maintain optimum paresthesia intensity and  pain management, patients must manually adjust their  stimulation parameters with their neurostimulator pro- grammer in order to counter changes in stimulation  associated with changes in body position (13). Alterna- tively, patients may change their body position rather  than change stimulation parameters. Despite improve- ments in patient programmers that include enhance- ments to the display and interface, some patients may  be reluctant to make frequent or repetitive program- ming changes during their daily activities. Patients may  also forget to bring their programmers with them or  may lose them. As a result, the ongoing need for and  inconvenience of programming adjustments can com- promise pain relief, cause patient frustration, and de- crease overall patient satisfaction with SCS therapy. The automatic position-adaptive stimulation fea- ture was designed to detect changes in body position  or activity in real time and to automatically adjust  stimulation amplitude according to patient prefer- ences. To assess the potential benefits and risks of this  T he gate control theory of pain, first proposed by  Melzack and Wall in 1965 (1), set the stage for  modern spinal cord stimulation (SCS). Shealy (2)  used the gate control theory as the basis for successfully  implanting the first SCS pain relief system in 1967  involving implantation of a monopolar electrode via  thoracic laminectomy. Since then, SCS has evolved into a  powerful nondrug therapy with proven effectiveness for  the treatment of intractable neuropathic pain including  chronic leg and back pain in well-selected patients (3- 11). Technological improvements over the past 40 years  have made SCS more useful for an increasing number  of patients. SCS systems are now highly programmable,  rechargeable, and capable of delivering stimulation to  wide areas of the spinal cord with multiple leads using  different electrode configurations. Variation in the  intensity and quality of stimulation due to changes in  body position has been a challenge that has vexed SCS  since its early days. None of the system enhancements  to date have addressed this issue. Patients undergoing  SCS perceive paresthesias which are directed to cover  the painful area through electrode positioning  and programming. Changes in the intensity of this  paresthesia resulting from positional changes may result  in either understimulation, including complete loss of  stimulation, or overstimulation. Overstimulation has  been described by some patients as an uncomfortable  jolting or surging sensation. It often requires manual  adjustment of stimulation parameters, which can  present a significant barrier to successful SCS therapy in  some cases (12,13). Variation in paresthesia intensity caused by chang- es in position or activity is an inherent aspect of SCS  therapy, because the strength of the electrical impulse  traveling from the epidural space where the electrodes  are placed to the targeted spinal tissue depends on the  distance between the electrode and the neural tar- get. This distance varies at different spinal levels and  changes dramatically with body position (14-18). Ana- tomically, the distance between an epidural electrode  and the spinal cord is a function of the thickness of the  tissues and spaces separating the two, which includes  the epidural vasculature and adipose tissue, the dura  mater, arachnoid membrane, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),  and pia mater. Of these, the thickness of the dorsal ce- rebrospinal fluid (DCSF) layer is the most variable and  comprises nearly all of the distance between the target  neural fibers and the SCS electrodes (14). Measurements of the DCSF layer have shown varia- tions in thickness among individuals and changes with  Fig. 1.

Methods Patient Selection This study was conducted under an FDA-approved  Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and approval  of the responsible Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of  the study centers. To participate in the study, patients  were at least 18 years of age and were indicated for  implantation of an SCS system for the treatment of  chronic trunk and/or limb pain. Patients were willing  and able to attend visits and comply with the study pro- tocol. Additionally, they were judged capable of using  the patient programmer and recharging the implant- able neurostimulator and were able to read and answer  questionnaires in English without assistance.  Patients were excluded if they had a prior implant- able SCS system; were currently enrolled or had plans to  enroll in another device or drug trial during the study  period; had unresolved legal issues related to their pain  condition for which they would be receiving neurostim- ulation; were pregnant; or required cervical placement  of leads. Study Design The schema for the study is shown in Fig. 1. Pa- tients were enrolled only after a successful SCS screen- ing trial and a minimum one-week post-screening  waiting period without stimulation. The definition of  a successful SCS screening trial was based on the phy- sician’s usual criteria for success and standard of care  for pain management. Concomitant medical therapy  was allowed, and no specific medications were con- traindicated or required during the study. Since pain  medication changes are rarely initiated solely to treat  positional changes, which are transitory in nature, pain  medication usage was not tracked during the study. Pa- tients enrolled were not selected on the basis of any  demonstrated need for stimulation adjustment during  position changes. After enrollment, patients completed a numeri- cal pain rating scale (NPRS) diary for 7 days in order  to assess baseline pain. Thus, a minimum of 2 weeks  without stimulation was required between the end of  a successful SCS trial and implantation of the neuro- stimulation device. Enrolled patients were implanted  with the RestoreSensor rechargeable neurostimulator  (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) which included the  optional position-adaptive stimulation feature known  as AdaptiveStim. During a 4-week postoperative period, only conven- tional manual adjustment of stimulation was enabled  Pain Physician: January/February 2012; 15:1-12 4   www.painphysicianjournal.com and patients were educated on the use of the patient pro- grammer. Since use of the patient programmer was critical  to the evaluation of pain relief and convenience, all pa- tients were required to demonstrate the ability to use the  programmer by the end of the 4-week postoperative pe- riod. Patients were then randomized to first receive either  SCS with conventional manual adjustment of stimulation  parameters or position-adaptive stimulation. Crossover to  the opposite type of stimulation occurred at 6 weeks post- randomization followed by 6 additional weeks of that SCS  therapy for a total of 12 weeks of follow-up.  Implantable Neurostimulation System Physicians could place up to 3 percutaneous leads in  the lumbar or thoracic epidural space. The RestoreSensor®  study device could be programmed to deliver position- adaptive stimulation while allowing additional manual  programming adjustment with a patient programmer, or  to deliver conventional neurostimulation therapy alone.  Position-adaptive stimulation must be enabled by the  clinician. It can then be turned on and off by the patient  or disabled by the clinician. When the position-adaptive  stimulation feature was disabled, the RestoreSensor neuro- stimulator was functionally equivalent to the currently  market-released RestoreUltra neurostimulator (Medtronic,  Inc., Minneapolis, MN). A patient programmer modified for the study au- tomatically recorded the number of individual button  presses and adjustments. The programmer served as an  automated diary that reliably captured manual therapy  adjustments. The patient programmer could be used to  fine-tune adjustments regardless of whether the position- adaptive stimulation feature was activated or disabled.   Position-Adaptive Stimulation The position-adaptive stimulation feature used a  3-axis accelerometer and associated software contained  in the implantable neurostimulator. The accelerometer  automatically sensed the patient’s body position and  activity, and the software automatically adjusted stimu- lation amplitude for that position to a level previously  defined by the patient and clinician. The default pa- rameters are designed to detect position change prior  to the patient achieving a final position. The moment  of detection in the arc of movement is programmable.  The system provided automatic adjustment for 6 posi- tions: sitting or standing upright; lying supine; lying  prone; lying on the right side; lying on the left side; and  upright and active. Device orientation was required pri- or to use of position-adaptive stimulation. During the  orientation process, patients were positioned upright,  lying back or lying front, lying left, and lying right. Data  from the 3-axis accelerometer were linked to positions  selected with the clinician programmer via the position- adaptive stimulation algorithm. The position-adaptive  stimulation feature was customized for each patient,  and the clinician defined the amplitudes for all or a  subset of the positions to meet specific patient needs. Follow-up Patients were followed weekly during the 4-week  postoperative period. After randomization, patient fol- low-up was: telephone contact at weeks 1, 3, and 5 and  office visits at weeks 2 and 4. Crossover to the opposite  type of stimulation occurred at week 6, and follow-up  included: telephone contact at weeks 7, 9, and 11 and  office visits at weeks 8 and 10. The final follow-up oc- curred at week 12.  At follow-up visits, programmed settings could be  adjusted consistent with the assigned treatment arm,  and the device could be reoriented. Patients were  asked to complete a 7-day pain diary prior to crossover  at week 6 and prior to the final office visit at week 12.  At the final visit, patients were asked to complete a  questionnaire comparing position-adaptive stimulation  with manual programming adjustment. Objectives Effectiveness The primary effectiveness objective was to dem- onstrate that use of position-adaptive stimulation pro- vided benefits to patients in terms of pain relief and/ or convenience compared with not using the feature.  Secondary effectiveness objectives were to summarize  the percent of patients who had worsened pain re- lief during the position-adaptive stimulation arm rela- tive to the conventional manual programming arm;  to compare the number of manual patient program- mer adjustments during both arms of the study; and  to compare the changes in NPRS score from baseline  to follow-up visits. Additional effectiveness objectives  were to collect and summarize patients’ experiences  regarding the use and benefit of position-adaptive  stimulation as well as physician impressions of the  clinical benefit of the feature. Safety The safety objectives were to compare the num- ber of patients who experienced adverse events as- www.painphysicianjournal.com   5 Sensor-Driven Position-Adaptive Spinal Cord Stimulation sociated with uncomfortable sensations from stim- ulation occurring during the 2 arms of the study.  Additionally, all adverse events reported from im- plant to completion of study visits or discontinua- tions were summarized. Assessment Methods The primary effectiveness objective (% success)  was assessed by determining the percent of patients  who had improved pain relief with no loss of conve- nience or improved convenience with no loss of pain  relief when using position-adaptive stimulation com- pared with manual programming. Pain relief and  convenience were assessed with separate 5-point Lik- ert scales at the 12-week follow-up visit. There was  no validated tool to assess the benefits of position- adaptive stimulation. The commonly used Likert scale  was chosen to assess experience with pain relief and  convenience because it could be easily understood by  patients and responses could be readily interpreted. For the secondary objective assessing worsened  pain relief with position-adaptive stimulation relative  to manual programming adjustment, the Likert scale  scores for pain relief were used. All manual button  presses for stimulation adjustment were logged by  the patient programmer. For the secondary objective  summarizing the change in pain scores from baseline  to follow-ups, patients were asked to complete pain  diaries for 7 consecutive days at baseline and before  the 6- and 12-week follow-up visits. Pain was assessed  on the 11-point NPRS with 0 meaning “no pain” and  10 meaning “pain as bad as you can imagine.” The  average scores of the last 3 of 7 diary collection days  were used for the pain scores for that visit. Patients  and physicians independently completed question- naires at the 12-week follow-up visit comparing the  benefits of position-adaptive stimulation to manual  programming adjustment. Patients entered their  answers directly onto the case report forms without  physician assistance or oversight. Device program- ming parameters were collected on the device print- out during patients’ clinic visits. To evaluate stimu- lation amplitudes by patient position, all programs  for the upright and supine positions in use at the  last study visit during the position-adaptive stimula- tion phase were analyzed. Note that a program is a  specific preset combination of the pulse width, rate,  and amplitude settings acting on a specific electrode  combination. Most patients had more than one pro- gram available to them.  Sample Size For the primary objective, assessing the benefits of  position-adaptive stimulation, the percent of patients  who reported improved pain relief with no loss of con- venience or improved convenience with no loss of pain  relief during position-adaptive stimulation arm relative  to conventional manual programming was required to  be statistically > 25%. Assuming the true percent suc- cess was 50%, a sample size of 60 patients provided  97% power to demonstrate the hypothesis using an  exact binomial one-sided test. To account for possible  attrition, up to 80 patients could be enrolled.  Randomization Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive first  either position-adaptive stimulation or conventional  manual adjustment of stimulation parameters, fol- lowed after 6 weeks by assignment to the alternative  adjustment method for an additional 6 weeks. Each site  received a box of envelopes containing the randomiza- tion sequence, and the envelopes were opened in the  provided order. Randomization was stratified by study  center. All physicians and patients were aware of the  assigned therapy sequence.   Statistical Analysis Analysis of the primary objectives was based on  intent-to-treat with the exception of patients who  discontinued from the study due to lead migration  or infection prior to the 12-week post-randomization  follow-up. A priori, these events were not considered  relevant to the evaluation of position-adaptive stimula- tion. For patients who dropped out for other reasons,  the missing data at 12 weeks was imputed as not suc- cessful for position-adaptive stimulation representing a  conservative handling of the missing data. A one-sided  P value of < 0.025 was considered statistically signifi- cant for the primary objective. Analysis of the secondary objectives and additional  study measures included all implanted patients who  provided a response. The number of manual program- ming adjustments and the change in NPRS scores from  baseline to various follow-up points were assessed us- ing the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The number of pa- tients with adverse events associated with uncomfort- able stimulation was compared in the 2 arms of the  study using McNemar’s test.  A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi- cant for secondary objectives. Statistical analysis was per- formed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Pain Physician: January/February 2012; 15:1-12 6   www.painphysicianjournal.com Results Study Population Seventy-nine patients from 10 interventional pain  management centers in the United States were enrolled  in the RestoreSensor Study between April 20, 2010 and  September 3, 2010. An IRB associated with each par- ticipating center approved the study protocol, and all  patients provided written informed consent. Of the 79  patients enrolled in the study, 32 (40.5%) were male,  and 47 (59.5%) were female. The mean age was 52.6  years (range 27-85 years). The most frequently reported  pain etiologies included radicular pain syndrome or ra- diculopathies, degenerative disk disease or herniated  disk pain, postlaminectomy pain, and failed back syn- drome. Patients usually had more than one pain eti- ology. Seventy-six patients were implanted with a Re- storeSensor neurostimulation device and randomized.  Thirty-six patients were assigned to receive automatic  adjustment of therapy with position-adaptive stimula- tion first followed by manual programming adjustment  second. Forty patients were assigned to receive neuro- stimulation with manual programming adjustment first  and position-adaptive stimulation second. The baseline  characteristics in both sequences were similar (Table 1).  All enrolled patients were naïve to a permanently im- planted SCS device, and no minimum NPRS score was  required for enrollment. In this regard, the study popu- lation was representative of the real-world pain patient  population. Seventy-one of the 79 enrolled patients  completed both treatment arms. Three patients were  discontinued prior to implant, and 5 were discontinued  after implant for the reasons shown in Fig. 2. Patients  were followed for at least 16 weeks post-implant. Of  the 76 patients randomized, 74 were included in the  intent-to-treat analysis for the primary effectiveness  objective. Two patients with infections leading to ex- plant were excluded from the intent-to-treat analysis as  predefined in the protocol. Primary Effectiveness Objective In the intent-to-treat analysis, 86.5% (64 of 74)  patients reported improved pain relief with no loss of  convenience or improved convenience with no loss of  pain relief while using position-adaptive stimulation  compared with using manual programming only (Table  2). Three of the 74 patients who did not complete the  study were imputed as treatment failures for the pur- poses of the analysis. The exact one-sided 97.5% lower  confidence limit was 76.5%, which was statistically sig- nificantly greater than the predefined minimum success  rate of 25%, (P < 0.001). The percent success did not  differ according to randomization sequence (P = 0.33).  Secondary Objectives Worsened Pain Relief Of the 71 patients with complete data, only 2 (2.8%)  reported worsened pain relief during the position-adap- tive stimulation arm relative to the manual program- Table 1.

Pain Physician: January/February 2012; 15:1-12 8   www.painphysicianjournal.com ming arm. One of these patients chose to leave position- adaptive stimulation on at the end of the study. Programming Adjustments Regardless of whether the patient was in the po- sition-adaptive stimulation or manual programming  adjustment arm of the study, the patient programmer  could be used to adjust stimulation parameters. The  daily average number of button presses for amplitude  adjustment in the position-adaptive stimulation arm  was 18.2 per day (standard deviation [SD] 38.9), which  was significantly lower than the 30.7 per day (SD 63.5)  in the manual adjustment arm (N = 69, P = 0.002). The  41% reduction in the average number of daily button  presses for amplitude adjustment is considered a clini- cally significant decrease in the programming burden  for the patients to manage their pain. Additionally,  patients in the position-adaptive stimulation arm had  an average of 15.9 days (SD 12.3 days) out of 42 days  without any manual adjustment compared with 12.5  days (SD 12.2 days) out of 42 days during the manual  programming arm, a statistically significant reduction,  P = 0.018. Change in Pain Score Overall pain scores decreased significantly for  patients in both study arms over the short course of  follow-up, P < 0.001. Patients in the position-adaptive  stimulation arm demonstrated greater improvement in  the NPRS score compared with those in the manual pro- gramming adjustment arm, though the difference fell  short of statistical significance. The mean reduction in  the NPRS score for average pain from baseline to the  end of the position-adaptive stimulation arm was 1.78,  representing a significant decrease from 5.92 to 4.14,  P < 0.001. The mean reduction in the NPRS score for  average pain from baseline to the end of the manual  programming arm was 1.48 representing a significant  decrease from 5.97 to 4.49, P < 0.001. Patient and Physician Assessments At the final week 12 visit, patients provided re- sponses to questions about their experience with posi- tion-adaptive stimulation relative to manual program- ming adjustment. All patients who provided responses  to specific questions were included in the analyses. Of  the 71 patients who recorded preferences on the case  report forms, 90.1% intended to leave position-adap- tive stimulation on all or most of the time or turn it  off as needed. Additionally, many patients reported  improvements in functional areas when using position- adaptive stimulation. Specifically, 80.3% reported im- provement in comfort during position changes, 69%  reported improved activity, and 47.9% reported im- provement in sleep (Table 3). Physicians reported that  position-adaptive stimulation provided added clinical  benefit for 88.7% of patients. Stimulation Amplitude by Positions Stimulation amplitude data for each program in  use at the last follow-up visit during the position-adap- tive stimulation arm (n = 200) were available for 72 of  the 76 randomized patients. A bar chart of the relative  percentage of stimulation amplitudes for 2 of the 6 po- sitions (supine versus upright) is shown in Fig. 3. Most  programs had lower amplitudes for the supine position  than for the upright position. On average, stimulation  amplitude for the supine position was 84% of the up- right position, with a range of 5-174%.  Safety Objectives In the analysis of adverse events associated with  uncomfortable stimulation, 7 patients experienced  the events only during the position-adaptive stimula- Table 3.

There was no statistical differ- ence in the number of patients who reported uncom- fortable sensations from stimulation during the posi- tion-adaptive stimulation and manual programming  adjustment arms (McNemar’s test, P = 0.804).  The adverse event profiles reported with and  without the use of position-adaptive stimulation were  similar, and no unanticipated adverse device effects  were reported. There were no patient deaths during  the study. Of the 76 patients who were implanted  with a neurostimulator and included in the adverse  events analysis, 66 reported 239 adverse events after  implant (74 events were device related and 165 were  not device related). The most frequently reported  device-related adverse events (≥ 5%) for all patients  in all phases of the study were undesirable change in  stimulation (27.6%); pruritus at the neurostimulator  pocket and/or lumbar site (6.6%); change in sensation  of stimulation (5.3%); implant site irritation (5.3%);  paresthesia (5.3%); and wound dehiscence (5.3%). Of  the 25 events (in 21 patients) related to undesirable  changes in stimulation, most were resolved by repro- gramming within 2-3 weeks of event onset. Only 9 of  these events had onset during the position-adaptive  stimulation arm of the study. Three patients reported  3 serious device-related adverse events (3.9%). Two  of the events (wound dehiscence; implant site infec- tion) led to explant and patient withdrawal from the  study. One patient who had a seroma completed the  study. Seven device-related adverse events which oc- curred in 6 patients were due to lead migration/dis- lodgment, of which one led to lead revision prior to  randomization.  discussion This prospective, randomized crossover study dem- onstrates that a position-adaptive stimulation feature  incorporated into an implantable neurostimulation sys- tem can automatically adjust the amplitude of neuro- stimulation to accommodate for changes in body posi- tion and activity in a real-world clinical setting. Most  patients reported improved pain relief and improved  convenience when using this feature compared with  neurostimulation requiring conventional manual pro- gramming adjustment. The study used a novel dual-ef- fectiveness primary objective requiring that the use of  automatic position-adaptive stimulation demonstrate  improvement in either pain relief or convenience, with- out worsening of either, compared with conventional  manual programming. The crossover design allowed  patients to experience both alternatives and to direct- ly compare their preference. The therapy alternatives  Fig. 3. The relative percentage was calculated as the stimulation amplitude used for the supine position divided by that for the  upright position and is shown for each program in use at the end of  the position-adaptive stimulation arm. A relative percentage  less than 100% indicates that lower stimulation amplitude was used for the supine position than for the standing position.   Pain Physician: January/February 2012; 15:1-12 10   www.painphysicianjournal.com were presented in a randomized order, although the  order did not influence preference. To demonstrate the clinical benefits of position- adaptive stimulation, the study targeted the patient  population currently indicated for SCS for the treat- ment of trunk and/or limb pain. There was no selection  for history of pain during position changes. The study  met the primary effectiveness objective with 86.5% of  patients reporting improved pain relief with no loss of  convenience or improved convenience with no loss of  pain relief when using position-adaptive stimulation.  Furthermore, nearly half of the patients reported both  much better pain relief and much more convenience  when using position-adaptive stimulation. The results  of the study confirm previous research noting position- mediated variability in patients’ perception of SCS and  suggest that automatic position-adaptive stimulation  could be of utility for many SCS patients. The observed changes in stimulation amplitude as- sociated with position changes demonstrate the need  for programming adjustments and the benefits of au- tomatic position-adaptive stimulation to enhance ther- apy effectiveness. The range of amplitude differences  seen between the upright and supine positions also  illustrates the need for individualization of automatic  adjustments. In terms of convenience, the 41% fewer  button presses during the position-adaptive stimula- tion arm validates the reported improvements in pa- tient convenience, and is particularly noteworthy when  considering that improvements in pain relief were also  achieved along with reduced patient programming  burden.  Physicians involved in the study reported that  88.7% of patients received clinical benefits from po- sition-adaptive stimulation. From the clinicians’ and  patients’ perspectives, orienting the position-adaptive  stimulation feature of the device to the various body  positions at the beginning of the study was reasonably  simple and not burdensome. The favorable response to  position-adaptive stimulation was quite pronounced  with 90.1% of patients intending to either leave posi- tion-adaptive stimulation programmed on all or most  of the time or turning it on or off as needed. This in- tention to continue use of the feature corroborates the  benefits observed in the study. In terms of functional  benefits, most patients reported improvement in com- fort during position changes and activity. Nearly half  the patients reported improvement in sleep.  Analysis of the secondary objective of worsened  pain relief demonstrated that of the 71 patients who  completed the study, only 2 reported worsened pain  relief during the position-adaptive stimulation arm. Of  note, the study also confirms the effectiveness of SCS  therapy for chronic trunk and/or limb pain. The reduc- tion in pain scores was statistically significant for pa- tients in both programming arms. Reduction in pain  with SCS devices has been demonstrated in previously  published randomized, controlled trials of SCS effec- tiveness (3-5). The study also demonstrated the safety of position- adaptive stimulation. There were no differences in the  frequency of uncomfortable stimulation or other ad- verse events between the position-adaptive stimulation  and manual programming arms. During the 4-month  study period, only 3 patients (3.9%) experienced a seri- ous device-related adverse event. Two of these patients  were explanted, one because of wound dehiscence and  the other because of wound infection. The third was a  seroma that resolved after aspiration, allowing the pa- tient to continue through the end of the study.  In view of the anatomic and physical basis for posi- tion-related variation in the intensity of neurostimula- tion, automatic position-adaptive stimulation capabil- ity for the device is a viable solution for this significant  problem. With current technology, it is not possible to  maintain a constant distance between the fixed lead  and the spinal cord with changes in body position. Pa- tients with implanted neurostimulators are bound to  move and change positions in their activities of daily  living, which for many patients is a goal of receiving  SCS therapy. Experience with position-adaptive stimula- tion in this study demonstrates that neurostimulation  systems with automatic position-adaptive program- ming adjustment can counteract variations in stimula- tion intensity associated with changes in position and  activity. It is, therefore, anticipated that with automatic  position-adaptive stimulation capabilities, SCS will be- come a more effective and more satisfying therapy for  future patients with neuropathic pain. Limitations Due to the open label study design, physicians and  patients were aware of the therapy assignment, though  the randomized crossover study design was intended to  mitigate the risk of physician or patient bias. The va- lidity of the primary outcome measure is supported by  the observation that 90% of patients chose to continue  using position-adaptive stimulation after the study. Re- sponses on questionnaires were subject to patient re- call. At the time of assessment of the position-adaptive  www.painphysicianjournal.com   11 Sensor-Driven Position-Adaptive Spinal Cord Stimulation stimulation feature relative to manual programming,  approximately half of the patients had just completed 6  weeks of treatment with position-adaptive stimulation  while the other half had just completed 6 weeks with  manual programming. Statistical tests did not reveal an  effect with regard to which treatment was experienced  most recently. Investigator influence on patient assess- ment was mitigated by having patients independently  enter responses to assessment questions directly on the  case report forms.  conclusions This study demonstrates that automatic position- adaptive stimulation is safe and effective in providing  benefits in terms of improvements in patient-reported  pain relief and convenience compared with using man- ual programming adjustment alone in patients indi- cated for SCS for the treatment of chronic trunk and/ or limb pain. Patients also reported improved comfort  during position changes and activity as well as improve- ments in sleep with this new technology. Position-adap- tive stimulation represents an important innovation in  SCS therapy. When selecting a SCS system for the treat- ment of chronic trunk and/or limb pain, the benefits  of position-adaptive stimulation merit consideration by  clinicians and patients.

Despite recent therapeutic advances, patients with refractory angina pectoris are  not adequately treated. Spinal cord stimulation is a minimally invasive and reversible technique which utilizes  electrical neuromodulation by means of an electrode implanted in the epidural space. It has been reported  to be an effective and safe treatment for refractory angina pectoris. We report a case of spinal cord stimulation  which has effectively relieved chest pain due to coronary artery disease in a 40-year-old man.

Copyright ⓒ The Korean Pain Society, 2012 As the development of coronary revascularization and  medication management have led to an improved survival  rate following coronary events in the last few decades, it  seems likely that the number of patients who remain se- verely disabled due to refractory angina will increase.  Refractory angina pectoris is a chronic condition char- acterized by the presence of severe chest pain, caused by  coronary artery disease (CAD), which cannot be relieved  by coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting,  and optimal medical treatment [1]. This limits the physical  activity of patients and leads to more frequent hospital  admissions. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an electrical  neuromodulation therapy, and it appears to be an effective  and safe treatment option for this specific group of pa- tients [2-7].  This is the first report of spinal cord stimulation used  to treat angina pectoris in South Korea. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old man was admitted to the emergency  department due to severe chest pain. He complained of  persistent tightness in the left anterior chest. An emergent  coronary angiogram (CAG) revealed total occlusion of the  proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).  Percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation  122 Korean J Pain Vol. 25, No. 2, 2012 www.epain.org Fig. 1. Coronary angiogram  (CAG) before and after  percutaneous coronary inter- vention (PCI). (A) CAG  shows total occlusion of the  proximal left anterior descen- ding coronary artery. (B)  After the PCI, successful re- perfusion was obtained.  in the LAD successfully restored coronary blood flow and  completely relieved his chest pain (Fig. 1). Five days later,  the patient began to complain of left anterior chest dis- comfort, which gradually worsened over the next two weeks.  Although the cardiologists again performed a detailed  evaluation of cardiac function, there were no changes in  the electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes and no in-stent  restenosis or de novo lesions seen on the CAG. Over the  next year, the patient visited the emergency department  and admitted several times due to his relentless chest pain,  thus the total days of hospitalization was about half a  year. Multiple cardiac evaluations were performed to eluci- date the cause of the angina. Another stent was implanted  in the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery  for intermediate stenosis. Ergonovine-induced spasm in  the right coronary artery was detected on another angiog- raphy, and the cardiologists added a calcium channel  blocker to the patient’s medications. However, these addi- tional interventions did not improve his symptoms. Adequate  results could not be obtained on an exercise electrocardio- gram, due to the patient’s poor exercise tolerance. Echo- cardiography showed persistent ischemic cardiomyopathy  with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. A follow-up  coronary angiogram showed patent previously stented ar- teries and no significant stenosis in other arteries.  When the patient was referred to the pain clinic, he  was experiencing paroxysmal deep anterior chest pain 2  or 3 times a day. The pain was of a squeezing and pressing  nature, 7 to 8 on a numeric rating scale (NRS, 0 = no pain,  10 = maximum pain), and was not relieved by sublingual  nitroglycerine. For several months, while the patient was  prescribed oral morphine 90 mg, gabapentin 1,800 mg,  and nortriptyline 20 mg per day, we tried various proce- dures to control his pain, such as stellate ganglion block,  percutaneous thoracic sympathetic neurotomy using ther- mal radiofrequency, epidural morphine injection, and intra- venous ketamine infusion. These techniques all had only  temporary efficacy. Finally, despite a continuous epidural  infusion of morphine, his paroxysmal angina was worsen- ing, rising to 8 to 9 on the NRS. After careful discussion with the patient and his fam- ily, they agreed to a trial of SCS. The patient was taken  to the operating room, monitored, and placed in the prone  position. Anesthesia was accomplished by local anesthetic  infiltration. A 15-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted in the  T4-5 interlaminar space under fluoroscopic guidance. The  epidural space was identified using a loss-of-resistance  technique. An Octad lead 3778 (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis,  Minnesota, USA) was inserted through the needle and ad- vanced under fluoroscopic guidance until the tip lay at the  C7-T1 intervertebral disc level (Fig. 2). The stimulation pa- rameters were pulse width of 270 μs, amplitude of 2.0 mA,  and frequency of 50 Hz. During the 10 days of trial stim- ulation, the intensity and frequency of the patient’s chest  pain was reduced by 60-70% without epidural infusion  of morphine. Therefore, a permanent pulse generator  (RestoreUltra TM, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota,  USA) was implanted into the subcutaneous space of the  right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The patient’s chest  pain decreased to 2 to 3 on the NRS, and he was satisfied  with a treatment regimen of SCS and oral morphine 90 mg,  gabapentin 1,800 mg, and nortriptyline 20 mg per day.

Although the doses of medication did not decrease, the  improvement in the patient’s clinical symptoms persisted  at the follow-up evaluation performed 1 year after surgery.  DISCUSSION Nowadays, most CAD patients can be adequately  treated with revascularization and anti-anginal medications.  However, some patients are still refractory to these treat- ments, or are poor candidates for percutaneous inter- vention, surgical revascularization, or additional procedures  [1]. A few patients with significant intermittent angina  demonstrate normal coronaries on angiography. The latter  condition is referred to as “microvascular angina” or  “cardiac syndrome X,” and is characterized by typical ex- ercise-triggered chest pain with ST-segment depression  on exercise electrocardiogram [8]. Patients with refractory  angina pose treatment dilemmas for the cardiac treatment  team, and are not adequately treated. Treatment options  that have emerged for refractory angina pectoris include  thoracic epidural injection, stellate ganglion blockade, en- hanced external counterpulsation, percutaneous my- ocardial laser revascularization, transcutaneous electric  nerve stimulation, and SCS [1,9]. Neuromodulation, such as SCS, can be defined as  electrical or chemical modification of the nervous system  that changes the actual or perceived neurotransmission  and response to a stimulus or condition. SCS is a minimally  invasive technique in which electrodes are implanted in the  epidural space to stimulate the dorsal columns of the spinal  cord by passing an electric current. Since the late 1960s  [10], SCS has been increasingly used in a variety of chronic  neurogenic pain conditions, as understanding of the mech- anisms of SCS has increased and its techniques and  equipment have been refined [11-13]. Since the first report of SCS as a treatment for angina  was published in 1987, a large number of subsequent clin- ical trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated the  clinical efficacy of SCS in angina pectoris in producing an  anti-ischemic effect, symptomatic relief, and improve- ments in functional status and quality of life [4-6,14]. A  recent meta-analysis revealed similar outcomes and lower  healthcare costs with SCS as compared to coronary artery  bypass grafting and percutaneous myocardial laser re- vascularization for the treatment of refractory angina [7].  Thus, SCS has been recommended by American College of  Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines  (class IIb) [15], and the European Society of Cardiology  Joint Study Group on the treatment of refractory angina  (therapeutic alternative 1) [1]. The basic background of SCS was the gate control  theory that stimulation of A-beta fibers modulates the  dorsal horn gate and therefore reduces the nociceptive in- put from the periphery [16]. However, further research  suggests that other mechanisms may play a more sig- nificant role. Potential explanations for the anti-anginal  and anti-ischemic effects of SCS include direct pain block- ing, reduced oxygen consumption, decreased sympathetic  tone, redistribution of myocardial blood flow from non-is- chemic to ischemic areas, possible improved coronary mi- crocirculatory blood flow, possible increase in beta-endor- phin levels, and modulation of intracardiac neurons [14,17,18].  124 Korean J Pain Vol. 25, No. 2, 2012 www.epain.org ST segment monitoring has demonstrated a reduction in  the total number and duration of ischemic episodes in SCS  patients [19]. Nevertheless, SCS remains underused, possi- bly due to its only partially understood mechanism of ac- tion, as well as the rapid development of transluminal re- vascularization procedures. The reluctance to employ SCS  for refractory angina may also result from the fear that  this technique would only treat pain without affecting is- chemia, thus concealing acute myocardial infarction.  However, it has been reported that SCS does not mask the  pain of myocardial ischemia as a warning signal for in- farction [19,20]. In the case discussed here, although the patient had  normal coronary arteries on CAG after revascularization,  his angina was persistent and aggravated. Cardiologists  decided that additional coronary intervention was not nec- essary for reducing his angina. After the patient’s referral  to the pain clinic, we tried various treatment options for  refractory angina pectoris. However, none of the methods  we tried prevented the progression of his pain. Finally, we  recommended SCS to the patient. SCS did not completely  eliminate his angina, but it successfully reduced his pain  and medication requirements.  In conclusion, patients with refractory angina pectoris  suffer from severe symptoms and impaired activities of  daily living. Spinal cord stimulation could allow them to  have reduced pain and improved quality of life. This case  might provide the impetus for increased consideration of  SCS as a therapeutic modality in this patient group in  Korea. REFERENCES  1.

Although multiple reports of caudad LM have been described, cephalad  LM has not been reported. Here we describe a case in which a stimulator lead  migrates in the cephalad direction. A 60-year-old male with failed back surgery  syndrome underwent SCS lead implantation via a dual lead approach to the top of  vertebral body (VB) T9. A standard strain relief loop was used for each lead in the  paramedian pocket. Postoperative testing revealed 100% paresthesia coverage  of the painful areas. For the first 4 days, the patient continued to have excellent  coverage; however, by the seventh day, the paresthesias ascended to above the  nipple line. At the 2-week follow-up, cephalad migration of the left lead to the  top of VB T1 was confirmed on fluoroscopy. The patient underwent successful  lead revision in which a single paramedian incision technique was used to place  extra sutures and a “figure-of-eight” strain relief loop. We provide the first case  report of significant cephalad LM following SCS lead implantation. This migration  can occur despite the use of current standard anchoring techniques. Additional  investigation into the mechanism of such LM and lead-securing techniques is  warranted.

LM is defined  as displacement of the wire from its original desired  location; it is caused by mechanical stress on an SCS  component and results in the loss of effective stimula- tion. Such a complication leads to an increased risk of  infection with each operative lead revision, in addition  to increased costs. In an era when cutting health care  expenditures is becoming increasingly important, cur- rent complication rates could curtail future acceptance  and utilization of SCS. We report a case of unusual LM to highlight the  importance of technical pitfalls despite the current  S pinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as an  efficacious and cost-effective treatment modality  for various neuropathic pain conditions, such as  failed back surgical syndrome (FBSS) (1-5) and complex  regional pain syndrome (6-9). Randomized controlled  trials have supported its use for these conditions and  have shown that it leads to improved quality of life,  increased activities of daily living, and reduced health  care costs (1,9). As additional research evolves, SCS will  continue to be utilized for other chronic neuropathic  pain states (10-13).  Complications of SCS have been reported at a rate  of 30–40% (14).

Case RepoRt SCS Lead Implantation A 60-year-old man with a history of FBSS had in- tractable chronic low back and bilateral lower extrem- ity pain for approximately 10 years. Upon evaluation in  our clinic, the patient had clinical evidence for the diag- nosis of FBSS and lumbar radiculopathy. Multiple trials  of medication, including antidepressants, anticonvul- sants, and opioids; physical therapy; and conservative  interventional pain management therapies, including  epidural steroid injections and facet blocks, had failed  to relieve his pain. Since the pain syndrome continued  to progress, interfered with daily living activities, and  decreased his quality of life, the patient agreed to un- dergo an SCS trial. He obtained more than 50% relief of  his bilateral low back and leg pain. He subsequently un- derwent SCS lead implantation without complication. For the implantation procedure, a standard para- median thoracolumbar approach was used. Dual lead  placement was planned. Tuohy needles were placed  into the epidural space at the level of the L1-2 inter- space from both sides. The epidural space was en- tered by using the loss of resistance technique to lead  blank. Each Medtronic octad spinal column stimulator  lead, model 37712 (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was  advanced on the contralateral side under live fluoros- copy and threaded cephalad just paramedian to the  anatomical midline to the top of vertebral body (VB) T9  (Fig. 1). Excellent paresthesia coverage of the bilateral  low back and legs was obtained with lead settings that  were identical to the trial (2 negative and 2 positive at  contacts 4-7, amplitude 10.2 V, pulse width 550 micro- seconds, and rate 60 pulses/s). The Tuohy needles were  then safely removed under live fluoroscopy, confirming  no change in lead tip placement. One nonabsorbable  suture was applied to the middle groove of the Titan  anchor, and cinched down to deform the anchor insert,  thereby securing the anchor to the respective lead.  Two nonabsorbable sutures were applied to flanking  grooves of the Titan anchor to secure the lead-anchor  complex to the lumbodorsal fascia. A strain relief loop  (SRL), consistent with current standard recommenda- tions (16), was used for each lead in the paramedian  pocket. The leads were drawn to the implantable pulse  generator (IPG) by standard tunneling and secured to it.  Normal impedance values were subsequently obtained.  The wounds were then irrigated with copious bibiotic  solution. The IPG was placed in the battery pocket with  standard SRLs beneath. The wounds were then closed  in the usual fashion. In recovery, confirmation of ap- propriate paresthesia coverage was obtained before  the patient was discharged. sCs Lead MigRation For the first 4 days after implantation, the patient  reported consistent coverage of the desired painful  areas, more than 80% pain reduction, and improved  daily functioning and quality of life. However, by the  fifth day, he experienced paresthesias up to the level of  the umbilicus, to the epigastrium on the sixth day, and  above the nipple line on the seventh day. The resultant  paresthesias and loss of low back and leg coverage led  the patient to turn off the SCS system.  Based on the literature and on our own clinical ex- perience with SCS, the leads most often are reported  to migrate caudally, resulting in the loss of desired  stimulation coverage and possibly causing the patient  to experience undesired stimulation in other areas.  This patient’s LM pattern, however, was atypical. The  differential diagnosis at this time included lead break- age and subsequent migration, or lead dislodgement  at the level of the anchor or the IPG connection. Surgi- Fig. 1.

Fluoroscopic image illustrating  cephalad lead migration, with the left-most lead at the top of   vertebral body level T1. www.painphysicianjournal.com   E81 Cephalad Lead Migration of Spinal Cord Stimulator cal planning took into consideration that the patient’s  lead may have completely fractured and migrated in  the cephalad direction, leading to paresthesias in the  anterior thoracic region, but not in the low back or legs.  However, scenarios involving open or short circuit, dis- connection, dislodgement, fracture, and other forms of  structural compromise were essentially ruled out be- cause normal impedances and continued stimulation  paresthesias were obtained while the SCS system was  turned on.  At the 2-week follow-up, fluoroscopic imaging con- firmed cephalad LM of the left lead tip to VB T1 (Fig.  2) and caudad migration of the right lead to VB T10.  Lateral views confirmed dorsal lead placement. Lead  integrity and connection with the IPG appeared to be  contiguous as assessed by scanning fluoroscopy and was  confirmed upon interrogation, ruling out physical com- promise to the lead itself. The patient was subsequently  scheduled for lead revision. SCS Lead Revision After the patient provided written informed con- sent, he was transferred to the operating room. A time- out was conducted, and the operative side was initial- ized. After induction of modified anesthesia care, the  patient was placed in the prone position and monitored  by a separate anesthesiology team with a noninvasive  blood pressure cuff, an electrocardiogram monitor, and  pulse oximetry. He received cefazolin 2 g IV < one hour  before incision. The thoracolumbar spine was prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Fluoroscopy was used to locate the indwelling  hardware in the region of the paramedian incision be- fore surgical approach was attempted. Fluoroscopic im- ages revealed the lead tip on the left at the top of VB  T1. The lead tip on the right was at the top of VB T10.  The skin and deeper tissues were anesthetized by  administering approximately 20 mL of 1% lidocaine  with epinephrine 1:200,000 kelvin via a 25-gauge, 3.5- inch needle. A skin incision was made with a #10 blade  over the old paramedian scar, and the tissue was care- fully dissected by electrocautery down to the level of  the lead-anchor-fascial complex. Careful hemostasis was  obtained throughout with electrocautery. The incision  was undermined in the medial and lateral directions,  creating a pocket. The Titan anchors already in place  were exposed without compromising the leads by us- ing careful, blunt dissection. Upon exposure of the in- dwelling anchor, it was evident that the prior SRL had  unraveled (Fig. 3A) and that at least one suture was not  secured to the anchor (Fig. 3B). The lead on the left  was found to move freely within the anchor when it  was gently pulled inferiorly through the anchor. Under  live fluoroscopy, the lead was carefully pulled down  the midline from the top of VB T1 to the top of VB  T8 (Fig. 4). We stopped at T8 instead of T9 to ensure  better capture of axial low back pain. The other lead  remained at the top of T10. Intraoperative stimulation  testing revealed excellent paresthesia coverage corre- sponding to the bottom 4 contacts of the revised lead. Next, 2 nonabsorbable sutures were used to secure  the anchor onto the lead (Fig. 5a). Thereafter, gentle  tugging of the lead inferiorly produced no slippage  through the anchor. Then, 2 nonabsorbable sutures  were used to secure the anchor-lead complex to the  lumbodorsal fascia. Again, gentle tugging of the lead  produced no slippage through the anchor, as con- firmed under live fluoroscopy.  Next, our attention was directed to the other an- chor in the same paramedian incision pocket. Upon full  exposure of that anchor, it was clear that at least one  suture was not secured to the anchor. Two nonabsorb- able sutures were used to secure the anchor onto the  lead. Gentle tugging of the lead produced no slippage  through the anchor. Then, 2 nonabsorbable sutures  were used to secure the anchor-lead complex to the  Fig. 3. SCS revision.

Again, gentle tugging of the lead  produced no slippage through the anchor, as confirmed  under live fluoroscopy.  Next, great care was taken to manage the excess  lead spanning the difference in length of 7 verte- bral levels within the paramedian pocket (Fig. 5a).  Since one SRL would be too large for the paramedian  pocket, several technical considerations were made.  It was possible that this excess lead originated at the  IPG pocket site from SRLs that became uncoiled after  implantation and ultimately migrated through the  tunnel into the paramedian anchor site, and distally  upon compromise of the anchor-lead complex. It was  not possible to move the excess lead from the para- median pocket through the tunnel toward the IPG  site. Although application of an additional anchor  in the paramedian pocket for the excess lead might  provide a “backup system” for preventing migration  (17,18), this procedure would have likely required an- other incision to access the IPG site and disconnect  the lead to apply the second anchor. Surgical opening  of the buttock IPG pocket site was considered, but  before acting on this premise, we attempted to spare  another incision and reduce infection risk by manag- ing the excess lead within the paramedian pocket.  We decided to manage the excess lead by creating a  “figure-of-eight” loop (Fig. 5b), effectively reducing  the medial-to-lateral cross-sectional area. We subse- quently tied down one nonabsorbable suture to the  fascia using an airknot at the intersection of the fig- ure-of-eight loop, taking care not to strangulate the  lead with forces that could compromise lead integ- rity. This figure-of-eight loop was intended to reduce  the likelihood of the excess lead unraveling and pos- sibly reduce the chance of effective LM by serving as  a pseudoanchor point in the system. A fluoroscopic  image showed no further migration of the leads.  Finally, the wound was irrigated copiously 3 times,  each time with 50 mL of bibiotic-containing solution.  A B Fig. 5.

B) Figure-of-eight strain relief  loop. Note the airknot suture around  intersection of  loops. www.painphysicianjournal.com   E83 Cephalad Lead Migration of Spinal Cord Stimulator Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with electro- cautery. The figure-of-eight strain relief anchoring loop  was tucked below as the fascial layer was closed with  interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures (Ethicon, Inc. Somerville,  NJ). Then the dermal-subdermal layer was closed with  interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures, followed by skin closure  with staples. Impedances were subsequently confirmed  on repeat testing. Dressings consisted of xeroform,  sterile gauze, op-site, and ioban.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was  transferred to the recovery area in stable condition  where appropriate postoperative paresthesia mapping  was confirmed. The patient was discharged home in  stable condition with no complications.  Follow-up At 2 and 6 weeks postrevision, the patient contin- ued to report excellent paresthesia coverage and pain  relief over the low back and bilateral legs, identical  to the benefit received from the initial implantation.  Confirmation of the absence of LM was obtained on  surveillance fluoroscopic imaging at 6 weeks postrevi- sion (Fig. 6). disCussion We believe that this represents the first report of  significant cephalad LM following SCS lead implanta- tion and should be observed in order to prevent injury.  For example, cephalad migration at the cervical level  could have led to significant spinal cord injury. LM is  among the most common complications of SCS. Such  a complication usually necessitates operative revision,  which carries additional risks and costs. In addition, few  SCS revision techniques have been described (18,19).  Fig. 6. Follow-up. Fluoroscopic image confirming the absence  of  lead migration at 6 weeks postrevision. Note the lead tip  at the top of  vertebral body level T8. A B Pain Physician: January/February 2012; 15:E79-E87 E84   www.painphysicianjournal.com Hence, the need exists for a better understanding of  LM and lead revision techniques.  Our patient developed LM approximately 4 days  after implantation, well before scar formation could  enable security of the lead-anchor-fascial complex.  Upon open revision, the lead was found to move freely  within the anchor, indicating compromise of the suture- anchor-lead complex. The excess lead is hypothesized  to have originated from the IPG pocket site. Although  standard SRLs were provided during the initial implan- tation, the loops had uncoiled, and the excess lead fol- lowed the path of least resistance, resulting in unusual  LM in the cephalad direction.  The underlying etiology of LM in our case was not  entirely clear, as spine trauma, infection, and muscle  spasm did not appear to precede loss of capture. The  usual safeguards as proposed by previous technical  assessments with SCS were followed (20). Perhaps of  significance, our patient reported repetitive vigorous  bending and rotational movements about the waist,  and sleeping with arms extended above the head, de- spite our precautions. The literature shows that LM is  most likely to occur during the first several weeks of  the implant, before tissue encapsulation of the system  has fully formed, and if the patient has subjected the  system to large displacements from vigorous activity  (14,20). Mechanisms of LM have been described (14,20).  Security of the lead-anchor complex relies heavily on  the bond created between the anchor and lead. Several  strategies for enhancing this bond have been described,  including the use of medical-grade silicone glue, al- though prospective evaluations of such technical con- siderations are lacking. Careful attention to suture  technique to enhance knot tightness, particularly with  the first throw of a surgeon’s knot, cannot be overstat- ed. As seen in our case report, the placement of more  than one suture for lead-anchor security may produce  a backup system for the prevention of LM, such that if  one of these sutures fails, the other suture is still viable.  More recently, novel approaches to lead security have  gained FDA approval and include mechanical locking  anchors using a twist-lock mechanism (Swift-Lock An- chor, St. Jude Medical, Plano, TX) and a torque-wrench  mechanism (Clik Anchor, Boston Scientific, Valencia,  CA) that does not require the use of sutures. Prospec- tive trials are indicated to ascertain which lead anchor- ing approaches, if any, are superior.   Additionally, the overall stiffness of an implanted  system, including the lead, extension and tissue, can  be calculated and used to predict forces imparted to  the implanted system (Fig. 7a). Forces applied to the  system, such as pulling the lead or extension taut, may  result in a short or open circuit or in LM. Current recom- mendations include allowing enough slack in the lead  or extension to accommodate patient movement. Coil- ing the excess lead body into a circular loop that is more  than 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter (16) reduces the risks of  kinking, damage, or electromagnetic interference and  its effects.  SRLs are used in a variety of other fields, including  electrical engineering (21), where such configurations  protect wires from damage in high-stress areas. A strain  relief device not only absorbs the pushing and pulling  forces exerted on the wire during use, but also increas- es its bend radius (16,22). An increase in the bend radius  increases the force required to cause lead displacement  (Figs. 7a and 7b). It is well appreciated that implanting  SCS leads without SRLs may reduce the functional sur- vival time of the lead; as a consequence, the SCS may  require reprogramming and/or early replacement of  the lead to restore effective therapy.  A paucity of literature exists for varying configura- tions of SRLs. Although data are unpublished, internal  evaluations have been performed. We theorize that if  the anchor-lead complex becomes dislodged or other- wise ineffective, the use of multiple SRLs (in our case, a  figure-of-eight loop) might provide an additional buf- fer to the SCS system against potential effects of longi- tudinal forces, further minimizing LM potential.  When evaluating the figure-of-eight SRL, key el- ements of the on-label SRL can be observed. In fact,  the figure-of-eight loop effectively provides the same  amount of slack as 2 of the on-label SRLs (assuming  the diameters are of equal size). The figure-of-eight  loop does not violate current rules of strain relief for  SCS; namely it exceeds a 2-cm radius and avoids a U- shaped configuration. However, according to unpub- lished, in vitro experimentation by Medtronic, this and  other multiloop configurations constrained by one or  more loose knots has shown a propensity for only one  of the loops to absorb a given displacement, result- ing in a tight bend radius being formed right before  the slack is consumed from the loop (Fig. 8). Although  the tight bend radius potentially could increase the  risk of lead compromise, tissue encapsulation around  the loops would likely prevent such an occurrence,  thereby aiding recovery of the strain relief back to the  starting diameter. Knot tightness and possible tissue  in-growth may restrict the free movement of the loop  Fig. 7. A) Typical force versus displacement graph. B) Effect of  loop size and allowable displacement. www.painphysicianjournal.com   E85 Cephalad Lead Migration of Spinal Cord Stimulator during a patient’s range of motion. It is important to  mention that an airknot suture was tied around the  lead to the fascia to reduce the risk of the SRL unrav- eling and was not cinched down onto the lead itself.  Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that lead  integrity does not appear to cause substantial physi- cal damage or electrical impairment when sutures are  tied securely directly onto the lead (23). That study  suggested that anchoring directly to the lead might  produce minimal damage, but these preliminary data  must be confirmed and expanded. Nevertheless, given  the theoretical risks of the figure-of-eight SRL based  on internal evaluation, Medtronic recommends the  use of the SRL configuration documented in the SCS  1x8 Implant Manual (16).  Despite persisting with vigorous activity, our pa- tient continues to derive significant benefit from SCS  revision. He has stable paresthesia coverage and pain  control, and the absence of LM has been confirmed  by surveillance fluoroscopic imaging (Fig. 6). The  SCS revision was performed with only one incision,  reducing the risk of infection that might occur with  additional incisions. Additionally, although more  hardware was effectively managed in the parame- dian pocket, the patient reported no discomfort in  this region after revision. We speculate that in addi- tion to restabilizing the lead-anchor-fascial complex,  extra SRLs in the figure-of-eight configuration may  have provided further protection against uncoiling  and subsequent LM.  ConCLusion This case is presented to: 1) remind readers of the  challenges of LM faced by implanters; 2) illustrate the  first report of significant cephalad LM following SCS lead  implantation; 3) raise awareness that cephalad LM may  occur despite standard techniques; 4) illustrate how to  detect LM should it occur; 5) postulate why this LM might  have occurred; 6) present troubleshooting that occurred  while limiting revision to one incision; 7) suggest the po- Fig. 8. Internal evaluation of  the figure-of-eight strain relief  loop revealed that one loop may decrease in diameter as the slack is  removed until only a small loop remains. Although this action potentially could increase the risk of  lead compromise, tissue en- capsulation around the loops would likely prevent such an occurrence. The additional loop adds a buffer to the longitudinal forces  applied to the SCS system. Pain Physician: January/February 2012; 15:E79-E87 E86   www.painphysicianjournal.com tential protective value of SRL on longitudinal lead mi- gration in general; and 8) introduce an alternative SRL  configuration that warrants further investigation.  Patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain  are often refractory to conventional medical and inter- ventional treatments and experience significant pain  and disability. While SCS may offer an alternative treat- ment, a technical learning curve remains. Lead migra- tion, the most common complication of SCS, is a major  barrier to success. In an era when cutting health care  expenditures is becoming increasingly important, cur- rent complication rates could curtail future acceptance  and utilization of SCS. This possibility underscores the  importance of a continued push toward technological  and technical advances, such that current techniques  for SCS are fine tuned, and complications associated  with this important treatment modality are reduced.  Further prospective investigation into the mechanism  of action, mechanism of complications, optimization  of surgical techniques, and long-term efficacy is war- ranted in order for SCS to become a widely accepted  mainstay treatment.   aCknowLedgeMents We graciously acknowledge Ms. Claire Levine for  editing support, and Mr. Bob Olson and colleagues at  Medtronic, Inc. for providing information regarding  the scientific background and internal evaluation of  the figure-of-eight strain relief loop.
