Nonpharmacological intervention ABSTRACT  
Background: The prevalence of treatment-resistant geriatric depression (GD) highlights the need for treatments 
that preserve cognitive functions and recognize polypharmacy in elderly, yet effectively reduce symptom burden. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a proven intervention for treatment-resistant depression in younger 
adults but the efficacy of TMS to treat depressed older adults is still unclear. This review provides an updated 
view on the efficacy of TMS treatment for GD, discusses methodological differences between trials in TMS 
application, and explores avenues for optimization of TMS treatment in the context of the ageing brain. 
Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify published literature on the antidepressant efficacy of 
TMS for GD. Databases PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched for English language articles in peer- 
reviewed journals in March 2021. 
Results: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (total n 260, active n 148, control n 112) and seven 
uncontrolled trials (total n 160) were included. Overall, we found substantial variability in the clinical 
response, ranging from 6.7% to 54.3%. 
Conclusions: The reviewed literature highlights large heterogeneity among studies both in terms of the employed 
TMS dosage and the observed clinical efficacy. This highlights the need for optimizing TMS dosage by recog -
nizing the unique clinical features of GD. We showcase a set of novel approaches for the optimization of the TMS 
protocol for depression and discuss the possibility for a standardized TMS protocol tailored for the treatment of 
GD.   
1.Introduction 
According to the World Health Organization, the world is facing a 
longevity revolution. The number of people aged 60 years and older in 
the population is growing at an unprecedented rate and will accelerate 
in future decades. In 2019, the number of people aged 60 years and over 
was 1 billion. This number will grow to 1.4 billion by 2030 and double to 
2 billion by 2050 (United Nations et al., 2020 ). 
Depression is a common condition worldwide and is the most com-
mon manifestation of psychological distress and emotional suffering in 
later life. Depression is the primary cause of disability worldwide, 
associated with significant impairment across numerous areas of func-
tioning and a substantial decrease in the quality of life in older adults (Friedrich, 2017 ). Depression is also the most common neuropsychiatric 
precursor of dementia identified in older adults (Roberto et al., 2021 ). 
Ultimately, depression increases the perception of poor health and the 
resulting request for health care services with related costs represents an 
estimated economic burden in the USA of over 200 billion dollars 
annually (Greenberg et al., 2015; Olchanski et al., 2013 ). 
Presently, the risk of mental health problems and decompensation 
from pre-existing depression is particularly high due to stressors caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic (Lee et al., 2020 ). The risk of depression in 
the context of social isolation and loneliness is extraordinarily high 
among older adults, who are also at a particularly high risk of severe 
complications of infection with COVID-19 (Ettman et al., 2020 ). 
Approximately 20–40% of patients with depression do not benefit

2sufficiently from the conventional antidepressant interventions, 
including medication and psychotherapy (Greden, 2001 ). Pharmaco -
logical treatments have limited efficacy, side effects are common (Car-
valho et al., 2016 ), and one-third of patients are medication-resistant, 
failing to achieve remission after using two or more antidepressants 
(Fava, 2003; Rush et al., 2006 ) and experiencing chronic depressive 
episodes (Nemeroff, 2007 ). 
The prevalence of treatment-resistant depression is higher in older 
adults who often show a lack of robust efficacy for conventional anti-
depressant treatments that significantly benefit depressed younger 
adults (Tedeschini et al., 2011 ). Older adults with geriatric depression 
(GD) frequently have an unfavorable course of disease with an increased 
risk of relapse (Licht-Strunk et al., 2009 ) and decreased probability of 
treatment response (Knochel et al., 2015 ). A major challenge in opti-
mally treating GD is the presence of comorbidities. GD patients often 
have physical frailty, vascular pathologies (Alexopoulos et al., 2008; 
Potter et al., 2016 ), greater risk of falling (Iaboni and Flint, 2013 ), more 
psychomotor impediment, and more disability (Fiske et al., 2009 ). They 
may also become more significantly cognitively impaired, especially in 
executive dysfunction (Lockwood et al., 2002 ). They have more psy-
chological stressors such as social isolation and caregiver dependence 
(Moos et al., 2005 ). They are also vulnerable to elder abuse - including 
physical, verbal, psychological, financial, and sexual abuse; abandon -
ment; neglect; and severe losses of dignity and respect. Elder abuse can 
lead to severe psychological consequences (Dong et al., 2013; Luo and 
Waite, 2011 ). Eventually, chronic treatment-resistant depression is the 
cause of persistent disability, increased risk of suicide, and greater 
medical morbidity (Russell et al., 2004; Sporinova et al., 2019 ). 
The high frequency of occurence of treatment-resistant GD highlights 
the critical need for treatments that preserve cognitive capacities, 
consider polypharmacy and physical frailty, yet effectively reduce 
symptom burden. One established nonpharmacological intervention for 
treatment-resistant depression is transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(TMS). 
1.1. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
TMS is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation by which a brief 
magnetic field passes through the scalp and induces an electrical current 
in the cerebral cortex. Barker et al. (1985) at the University of Sheffield, 
UK introduced the first, ‘modern-era ’ TMS device. Prior to that, explo -
rations around electromagnetic induction for brain activation went back 
to the seminal discoveries by Michael Faraday in 1831, and included a 
number of filed and issued patents around notions of therapeutic uses in 
brain sciences, including for the treatment of depression (Horvath et al., 
2011; Walsh and Pascual-Leone, 2003 ). The operating mechanism of a 
TMS stimulator includes a capacitive high-voltage, high-current 
charge-discharge system connected via an electronic switch (thyristor) 
to the inductor of the stimulation coil (Wagner et al., 2007 ). 
Passing a short and strong pulse of current via a coil positioned on 
the scalp generates a magnetic field that penetrates skin and skull, and 
reaches the brain where it induces electrical currents according to the 
physical principle discovered by Michael Faraday (Barker et al., 1985 ; 
Wassermann et al., 2008 ). A TMS pulse can modulate neural activity 
directly in a spatially and temporally focused manner to depolarize 
neurons, modify intracortical excitability, and activate distant 
cortical-subcortical and spinal structures along specific connections. The 
impact of a TMS pulse on the brain is dependent on several different 
factors, including the power of the magnetic flux, the shape of the 
stimulation coil, the shape and duration of the pulse, the distance and 
orientation between the coil and the cortical surface, the direction of the 
induced electrical currents, the specific repetition of electric pulses, and 
the underlying cortical structure and activity. 
Early studies were conducted to measure the ability for TMS to 
interact with brain activity and behavior, for example, inducing speech 
arrest (Pascual-Leone et al., 1991, 2000 ). More recently, the combination of TMS with other neuroimaging technologies such as PET, 
EEG, and fMRI has made it possible to show that the changes induced by 
TMS are propagated throughout the rest of the brain by dynamic 
network interactions (Bestmann et al., 2008; Shafi et al., 2012 ). 
Application of repetitive pulses of TMS at specific frequencies and 
patterns, enables modulation of cortical excitability beyond the duration 
of the TMS train itself, and opens up the possibility of therapeutic ap-
plications (Pascual-Leone et al., 1994 ). Initial studies showing the effi-
cacy of repetitive TMS (rTMS) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex in the treatment of medication-resistant depression (Pascual- -
Leone et al., 1996 ) were followed by a rapidly expanding number of 
randomized and multi-site clinical trials (Perera et al., 2016 ) and 
eventually, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 
Neuronetics TMS device for the treatment of medication-resistant 
depression in 2008 (George et al., 2010; O’Reardon et al., 2007 ). 
Since then, the use of rTMS has rapidly expanded (Zheng et al., 2020 ): A 
number of other devices have also gained FDA clearance and obtained 
the CE mark, many health care systems and health insurances have 
endorsed TMS and cover its treatment costs, safety recommendations for 
TMS use and for training in TMS delivery have been developed and 
endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology 
(Rossi et al., 2021 ), and many patients are being helped worldwide. 
1.2. Pathophysiology and neural networks relevant to geriatric depression 
Current models conceptualize depression as a network disorder 
associated with alterations in a distributed set of brain regions (Price and 
Drevets, 2010 ) Fig. 1. The left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) 
and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) have been consis -
tently related to depression symptomatology (Mayberg, 2001 , 2003 ; 
Pizzagalli, 2011 ). Specifically, the sgACC is hyperactive in depression, 
and a decrease in this hyperactivity is related to the antidepressant 
response. On the contrary, the L-DLPFC is hypoactive in depression, and 
an increase in activity is associated with antidepressant response. 
In GD, the pathophysiology diverges from younger depressed in-
dividuals for several reasons. For example, aging disease-related pro-
cesses such as inflammation, vascular disease, and amyloid 
accumulation are more prevalent among older adults, promoting 
dysfunction in frontal-subcortical networks, mediating the expression of 
depression, and promoting chronicity and recurrence (Lindenberger, 
2014 ). Other contributing factors such as hypertension, diabetes, 
obesity, hormonal modifications, changes in neuroplasticity, and syn-
aptogenesis start in mid-life, continue during aging and are more evident 
in older adults (Fiske et al., 2009 ). Moreover, older adults are prone to 
social isolation, and in some communities, they have limited access to 
health care, even more during the COVID-19 pandemic. All these 
stressors may also trigger inflammatory and other maladaptive re-
sponses leading to brain network disorders (Maydych, 2019; Moos et al., 
2005; Slavich and Irwin, 2014 ). 
Structural and functional brain network abnormalities have been 
reported in GD. Diffusion tensor imaging studies of GD have found 
microstructural lesions in white matter tracts that connect the prefrontal 
cortex with subcortical and posterior cortical regions, which have been 
associated with executive dysfunction (Alexopoulos et al., 2008; 
Gunning-Dixon et al., 2008 ). These structural and functional changes 
are associated with an executive dysfunction depressive syndrome that 
has been described in older adults with distinct clinical presentation 
characterized by anhedonia, apathy, psychomotor retardation, lack of 
insight, and inadequate response to antidepressants. 
For example, hypoactivity in resting functional connectivity in the 
cognitive control network (CCN), including the dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortex (dACC) and the DLPFC during depressive episodes, has been 
found in older adults (Alexopoulos et al., 2012 ). Behavioral tasks 
engaging the CCN show a hypoactivation of the DLPFC and decreased 
functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the dACC in GD as 
compared to non-depressed older adults (Aizenstein et al., 2009 ). D. Cappon et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Ageing Research Reviews 74 (2022) 101531
3Conversely, GD’s hyperactivity within the default mode network (DMN) 
is consistent with previous findings in depressed adults (Sheline et al., 
2010 ). The DMN mediates self-referential thinking, including the pro-
cessing of the past events and planning for the future evaluating beliefs 
and intentions of others (Raichle et al., 2001; Raichle and Snyder, 2007; 
Sheline et al., 2009 ). The DMN includes connections between the medial 
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (pACC) and is 
inhibited during cognitive activities and active during internal menta -
tion. Also, the salience network (SN), comprising the insula and amyg -
dala, is hyperactive in GD, degrading the ability to assess the 
significance of external stimuli and assigning emotional and motiva -
tional value to those stimuli (Hermans et al., 2014; Mulders et al., 2015 ). 
TMS is particularly appealing for treatment of GD because of its 
ability to modulate brain network interactions inducing electrical cur-
rents in the DLPFC to rebalance the cortico-limbic governance (Fox 
et al., 2012 ). TMS for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in the adult 
population has proven to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in mul-
tiple randomized controlled trials (George et al., 2010; Levkovitz et al., 
2015; Pascual-Leone et al., 1996 ). TMS provides additional advantages 
in older adults, including lack of side effects compared to antidepressant medication, and lack of cognitive side effects compared to electrocon -
vulsive therapy (ECT). Nevertheless, only around 50% of patients with 
medication-resistant depression treated with TMS obtain improvement 
of depressive symptomatology, of whom only 25–30% attain remission 
(Blumberger et al., 2018; Fitzgerald, 2020 ). These limits in the clinical 
efficacy highlight the need to optimize the TMS treatment. For this 
reason, many recent attempts have been devoted to the refinement of 
the TMS protocol (e.g., dosage and targeting) to improve antidepressant 
efficacy. However, these attempts are based on brain models of younger 
individuals, raising questions about applicability to treatment of GD, 
particularly considering the effects of aging on the anatomy and 
neurochemistry of the brain. For example, age-related brain atrophy 
might cause more distance between the coil and the brain tissue as well 
as increase cerebral spinal fluid influencing the propagation of the 
current generated by a TMS pulse (Murphy et al., 1992; Scahill et al., 
2003; Wagner et al., 2008 ). This suggests that specific efforts should be 
devoted to optimizing TMS therapy for GD taking into consideration 
structural and functional brain changes in older adults. 
Some have argued that older individuals might be less likely to 
respond to TMS treatment for depression, but subsequent studies have

4not supported such claims, suggesting that TMS is a promising treatment 
for GD. In 2015, Sabesan et al. considered the factors that can moderate 
the clinical effect of TMS in GD (Sabesan et al., 2015 ). In 2018, Iriarte 
and George reviewed the factors that influence the response to TMS in 
elderly (Iriarte and George, 2018 ). In 2020, van Rooij et al. discussed the 
influence of the aging brain on rTMS efficacy for GD and highlighted the 
importance of developing specialized rTMS protocols for treating 
depression in the elderly (van Rooij et al., 2020 ). To build on these 
previous publications, in the present paper, we provide a brief intro-
duction to TMS and an updated systematic review of the current liter-
ature surrounding TMS treatment for GD, and simultaneously explore 
potential avenues for the optimization of TMS intervention for GD. Our 
first aim is to offer a systematic review of the evidence regarding efficacy 
of TMS for treating depression in older adults. Our second aim is to give 
the reader an illustration of the methodological commonalities and 
differences of the studies published so far. The third aim is to discuss the 
recent evidence about the optimization of TMS protocols to improve 
antidepressant efficacy taking into consideration some aspects specific 
to older adults that might affect TMS efficacy. Finally, we propose a 
framework of determinants to take into consideration for future 
investigation. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Literature search 
A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and 
PsycINFO databases in March of 2021. The following search terms were 
used: “(Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation OR TMS) AND (geriatric OR 
elderly OR old OR late life) AND depress* ”. Peer-reviewed articles 
written in English and published before the date of the literature search 
were included. 
2.2. Eligibility criteria 
We sought to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that 
directly investigated the efficacy of rTMS in samples of GD patients. Due 
to the limited number of published studies that fit these criteria, the 
search was expanded to include uncontrolled trials. A criterion for in-
clusion was the implementation of a standardized depression rating 
scale (e.g., Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) or Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI)) as the study ’s primary outcome. One co- 
author assessed the eligibility of publications for inclusion based on 
their title and abstract. The selected publications were then evaluated by 
a second co-author before their inclusion was finalized. Lastly, the 
reference lists of the included publications were searched for additional 
relevant trials. 
3.Results 
We found 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Patient charac -
teristics, experimental design, outcome measures, and main results are 
summarized in Table 1. The parameters of TMS stimulation employed in 
these studies are shown in Table 2 for RCTs and uncontrolled studies. In  
Fig. 2 we summarize the TMS parameters used by the RCTs and we 
highlight the dosing of the RCTs compared to the approved protocol by 
the FDA. Table 3 and Fig. 3 show the number of patients that responded 
or remitted after TMS intervention. 
3.1. RCTs rTMS for geriatric depression 
We found 7 RCTs which evaluated the efficacy of rTMS for GD. All participants included in these trials were at least 50 years old. Manes 
et al. (2001) conducted the first RCT on the efficacy of rTMS in a sample 
of patients with GD (n20, age ≽50, m60.7, SD9.8). Patients 
received 5 daily rTMS sessions to the L-DLPFC at 20Hz with an intensity 
of 80% of motor threshold (MT) or sham stimulation. Even though they 
found no group significant difference in the change in HAM-D score from 
baseline to post-treatment between the active (22.7 –14.4) and sham 
(22.7 –15.5) group (p0.66), the 6 participants who responded to the 
treatment (defined as a decrease in HAM-D score of at least 50% and no 
longer meeting the criteria for major or minor depression) had signifi -
cantly larger frontal volume than compared to non-responders 
(p0.03). 
A similar study was conducted by Mosimann et al. (2004) with a 
sample of 24 GD patients (40–90 years old, m62, SD12) who un-
derwent 10 rTMS sessions of either 20Hz of active stimulation at 100% 
MT to the L-DLPFC or sham stimulation. Participants in both the active 
and the sham group improved in HAM-D scores by between 17% and 
20%. However, no between-group effects were observed. Jorge et al. 
(2008) conducted two experiments with patients with GD. In the first 
experiment 30 participants (age ≽50, m62.9, SD7.2) received 10 
daily rTMS sessions. Participants either received 10Hz stimulation over 
the L-DLPFC at 110% MT or sham. The difference in HAM-D-17 scores 
between the active group (33.1% decrease) and the sham group (13.6%) 
reached statistical significance (p0.04). In the second experiment, 62 
participants (age ≽50, m64.3, SD7.2) received 15 rTMS sessions 
using the same parameters as in the first experiment or sham. Again, the 
difference in HAM-D-17 scores between the active group (39.4%) and 
the sham group (6.9%) reached significance (p0.003). Interestingly, 
the response rates (defined as a larger than 50% decrease in HAM-D-17 
score between baseline and post-treatment) were negatively associated 
with age and positively associated with frontal gray matter volume. 
Both Manes et al. (2001) , as well as Jorge et al. (2008) indicate a 
relationship between lower rTMS efficacy rates and frontal atrophy. To 
address this, Kaster et al. (2018) explored the efficacy of high-dose deep 
rTMS, in 52 GD participants (age m72.4, SD2.10). Participants had 
20 sessions of either 18Hz stimulation to the L-DLPFC and ventrolateral 
PFC at 120% of MT or sham. There were significant differences in both 
the response and remission rates (defined as a 50% decrease in 
post-treatment score relative to baseline for 2 consecutive weeks, and a 
post-treatment HAM-D-24 score equal to or below as well as a 60% 
decrease in HAM-D-24 compared to baseline for 2 consecutive weeks, 
respectively) between the active (response: 44%, remission: 40%) and 
sham group (response: 18.5%, remission: 14.8%) (pD0.05). Trevizol 
et al. (2019) investigated whether bilateral rTMS displays superior ef-
ficacy for GD relative to unilateral and sham rTMS. Data from two 
mixed-age sample studies with similar methodologies were pooled 
(Blumberger et al., 2012, 2016 ) and only a subset of the data comprised 
of elderly patients was analyzed (age range60–85). 42 participants 
(age60–85, m65.7, SD6) underwent 15 sessions of low fre-
quency 1Hz rTMS either bilateral or to the right-DLPFC followed by 
high frequency 10Hz rTMS to the L-DLPFC, or sham. There were sig-
nificant differences in the response and remission rates (defined as a 
50% reduction in HAM-D-17 scores from baseline, and a HAM-D-17 
score equal to or lower than 10, respectively) between the three con-
ditions (response - bilateral: 45%, unilateral: 0%, sham: 16.7%, 
p0.016, remission – bilateral: 40%, unilateral: 0%, sham: 0%, 
p0.014) with the effect driven by the bilateral condition. Leblhuber 
et al. (2019) investigated the efficacy of 10 rTMS sessions to the PFC 
bilaterally at 3Hz compared to sham for 29 (sham10) GD patients 
(age m72.4, SD2.10). A significant decrease in HAM-D-7 scores 
was observed post-treatment, relative to baseline, for the active group 
(baseline: m12.9, SD0.89 – post-treatment: m10.2, SD0.67, D. Cappon et al.

In summary, across 7 RCTs a total of 260 patients were studied (148 
in the active and 112 in the sham groups). Most of the RCTs employed a 
conventional rTMS protocol with a figure-8 coil (except for Kaster et al., 
2018 and Leblhuber et al., 2019 , who employed an H1 coil and a 
Theracell magnetic loop, respectively). The RCTs with a conventional rTMS protocol and a figure-8 coil employed stimulation parameters that 
differ significantly from those prescribed by the FDA approved protocol 
with conventional rTMS and a figure-8 coil. Firstly, the FDA protocol 
prescribes a total pulse count of 90,000 pulses, whereas these RCTs 
incorporated a lower pulse count, effectively underdosing TMS. Sec-
ondly, the FDA protocol stipulates 4–6 weeks (20–30sessions) of TMS 
and the use of 10Hz at 120% MT intensity (McClintock et al., 2018 ). Table 1 (continued )

7However, the reviewed RCTs did not match these parameters. Fig. 2 
plots the parameters space for the published RCT ’s versus the FDA 
stipulations for the conventional rTMS protocol. To accurately define 
the clinical profile of TMS for GD it would be essential that studies dose 
similar to the FDA protocol that matches their treatment design. 
3.2. Uncontrolled studies of rTMS for geriatric depression 
We included 7 uncontrolled studies that investigated the efficacy of 
TMS in seniors with GD. Mosimann et al. (2002) conducted an open 
label study with 13 patients (mean age56.4, SD12.7) who received 
high frequency rTMS (20Hz) to the L-DLPFC (1600 pulses/14 sessions). 
A significant decrease in the HAM-D score was observed. They also 
found that cortico-scalp distance, which is causally related to frontal 
atrophy, was negatively correlated to reductions in HAM-D score. To 
address this issue, Nahas et al. (2004) adjusted the stimulation intensity 
according to patients ’ DLPFC atrophy levels for a sample of 18 GD pa-
tients (range55–75). Again, a significant reduction in HAM-D scores 
was observed. The average reduction in scores was larger than the one 
observed by Mosimann in 2002 (35.2%±28.8 versus 21.2%±18.0) 
(Mosimann et al., 2002 ), potentially reflecting the success of adjusting 
for the scalp-cortical distance. Fabre et al. (2004) stimulated the 
L-DLPFC of 11 GD patients (age rangeF55, mean67.9, SD6.7) at 
10Hz (10 sessions, 100% MT). Five participants responded to the 
treatment (defined as a greater than 25% decrease in HAM-D score). 
Notably, these five participants had less frontal atrophy and better 
cognitive functioning, especially demonstrated by higher scores on the 
Trail Making Test as well as the Digit Span test. Abraham et al. also 
stimulated the L-DLPFC at 10Hz and 100% MT for 10 sessions of 19 GD 
patients aged over 60 years (mean66.8, SD6.4) and found a sig-
nificant decrease in HAM-D scores. Out of these 19 patients six met 
criteria for response (F50% improvement in HAM-D) and two met 
criteria for remission (End Score HAM-D ≼8) (Abraham et al., 2007 ). 
Another study was conducted at two different sites. At the first site 20 
patients with GD were stimulated to the L-DLPFC at 10Hz. At the second 
site, a total of 29 patients were split into three groups: 11 received 10Hz 
to the L-DLPFC, 14 received 1Hz to the right DLPFC, and 4 participants 
received a combination of the two (although the authors did not specify 
how the two stimulations were combined) (Milev et al., 2009 ). They 
found a significant decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by the 
HAM-D and BDI, with no statistically significant difference in the change 
of HAM-D score between patients stimulated to the L-DLPFC (26.1% reduction) and the Right-DLPFC (26.7% reduction) (p0.40). Dard-
enne et al. (2018) conducted a trial with 10 seniors (age range65–82, 
mean73.9, SD5.7) who were stimulated at the L-DLPFC with 
high-frequency (20Hz) at 110% MT for 20 sessions. Both HAM-D and 
BDI scores displayed a significant reduction. A large open-label study 
with 70 GD patients (age range F60, mean66.6, SD5.8) employed 
25Hz rTMS at 100% MT for 18 sessions (Sayar et al., 2013 ). Consistent 
with the previous studies, a significant decrease in the HAM-D score was 
observed. 
In summary, a total of 160 participants were included across the 7 
open label trials. There was significant variance in the TMS parameters 
employed by the different trials, for example in the rTMS frequency. 
Authors often did not present explicit reasoning behind their choice of a 
specific frequency or set of stimulation parameters. To the best of our 
knowledge, there is no solid physiological evidence to suggest that one 
frequency would lead to higher efficacy than another. Therefore, we 
suggest that future studies adhere to the conventionally used frequencies 
(10Hz or 1Hz) since their clinical value is already established or 
articulate a testable hypothesis and gather data to evaluate it. For 
example, it is reasonable to assume that personalized stimulation pa-
rameters, e.g. optimizing rTMS frequency to an individuals ’ EEG oscil-
latory frequencies as in ‘synchronized ’ TMS (sTMS), might prove more 
effective (Leuchter et al., 2015 ). However, further studies are needed to 
fully test such notions. Most importantly, similar to the above reviewed 
RCTs, most open label studies significantly under dosed the TMS pulse 
count when compared to the equivalent FDA approved protocol (con-
ventional rTMS and figure-8 coil). 
3.3. Safety of rTMS for geriatric depression 
Overall, TMS is a safe intervention for GD. Most of the reviewed 
studies did not report any significant adverse events (Dardenne et al., 
2018; Fabre et al., 2004; Kaster et al., 2018; Leblhuber et al., 2019; 
Manes et al., 2001; Milev et al., 2009; Mosimann et al., 2002; Nahas 
et al., 2004; Sayar et al., 2013 ). The adverse events that were reported 
were mild and transient. These events included discomfort or pain on the 
head around the stimulation site, headaches, as well as nausea and 
crying (Abraham et al., 2007; Jorge et al., 2008; Mosimann et al., 2004 ). 
The frequency of these adverse events was low, and the controlled trials 
did not observe a significant difference in the number of reported 
adverse events between the active and the sham groups. Tolerability for 
TMS as intervention for GD was high. Most studies did not report any 
Fig. 2.Parameters space for randmoized controlled trials (RCTs) TMS studies for geriatric depression . On the left the stimulation intensity and the total 
number of sessions are plotted for each RCT alongside the FDA approved protocol. On the right the total pulse counts for each RCT and the FDA protocol are plotted. 
It is striking that the vast majority of RCTs used parameters that effectively under dosed rTMS relative to the corresponding FDA-cleared protocol. Most protocols 
(including the FDA ’s) incorporated conventional rTMS and a figure-8 coil, except for Leblhuber et al. (2019) and Kaster et al. (2018) , signified by the asterisks. 
Leblhuber et al. (2019) varied stimulation intensity per participant and is thus not included in the parameter space graph on the left. Trevizol et al. (2019) employed 
two different TMS protocols, one with a total pulse count of 18,225, and another with a total pulse count of 31,500 (represented on the right with red and yellow, 
respectively). D. Cappon et al.

Mosimann et al., 2002, 2004 ; Nahas et al., 2004 ). In the few studies 
where treatment-related withdrawals were reported, the dropouts were 
limited, ranging between 1 and 3. For example, Abraham et al. (2007) 
reported one participant drop out due to local pain on the scalp at the 
stimulation site during treatment (n20). Kaster et al. (2018) reported a participant withdrawal due to stimulation induced discomfort 
(n52). Milev et al. (2009) reported that a participant withdrew 
because of discomfort and the occurrence of headaches (n49). Tre-
vizol et al. (2019) had a single participant drop out because they could 
not tolerate the treatment (n43). Lastly, Sayar et al. (2013) reported 
three withdrawals due to worsening of symptoms or

9TMS dropouts are very few, supporting the tolerability of TMS in geri-
atric patients. 
4.Discussion 
Depression is highly prevalent in the elderly: about 14% are diag-
nosed with a depressive disorder, of which at least 2% meet the criteria 
of MDD (Ageing, n.d). As the average population gets gradually older, 
GD is becoming a growing and important public health problem. Here, 
we provide a systematic review of the current literature on the efficacy 
of TMS in treating GD. The reviewed evidence supports a high degree of 
tolerability and safety and has also proven significant therapeutic effi-
cacy for TMS in patients with GD. Importantly, there are some potential 
advantages to using TMS in older adults and there is also no evidence 
against the value of rTMS in the elderly with depression. 
4.1. Therapeutic efficacy of TMS for geriatric depression 
The reviewed studies indicate that TMS treatment for GD is favor -
able, although the variance in response and remission rates between the 
trials indicates room for optimizing the treatment. Out of the reviewed 
RCTs, three of the six that reported on response rates found a significant 
difference in the number of responders between the active and the sham 
groups. Three of the five RCTs that reported on remission rates found a 
significant difference between the active and the sham group (Table 3). 
Seven of eight of the uncontrolled trials observed responders to the 
treatment and six observed remitters (Table 3). Importantly, there was 
considerable variability in the response and remission rates for both 
RCTs and the uncontrolled trials, ranging from 6.7% to 54.3% for 
response and 8.2–40.0% for remission . In the following paragraphs we 
discuss some potential factors that could be driving this heterogeneity. 
4.2. TMS Intensity and cortex-scalp distance 
The variability in efficacy rates could be related to the idiosyncrasies 
of the samples. Studies have shown that frontal atrophy levels are very 
variable among elderly (Peters, 2006). Studies have shown that a larger 
distance between the scalp and the frontal cortex is related to a lower 
clinical outcome in rTMS treatment for GD, which has been recently 
reviewed by Sabesan et al. (Manes et al., 2001; Mosimann et al., 2002; 
Sabesan et al., 2015). This is most likely due to the decreased strength of 
the electrical field at the stimulation target site. Therefore, the 
discrepancy in clinical outcome between and within the trials could be a 
consequence of significant differences in frontal atrophy levels between 
samples of different trials. Unfortunately, an insufficient number of the 
reviewed trials recorded participant frontal atrophy to conduct a formal 
analysis. (Nahas et al., 2004). For example, Manes et al. (2001) stimu -
lated the L-DLPFC at 80% MT and did not find a difference in either 
response or remission rate between the active and the sham group, while 
Jorge et al. (2008) stimulated the L-DLPFC at 110% MT and found a 
significant difference in both the response and remission rate between 
the treatment and control group. Therefore, Nahas et al. (2004) pro-
posed that adjusting the stimulation intensity according to individual 
cortico-scalp distance may be a way to compensate for the frontal 
atrophy. 
Besides the direct effects of the frontal atrophy, the concomitant 
increase of cerebrospinal fluid may influence the direction of the cur-
rent, and consequently the electric field generated in the targeted region 
of the cortex (Fishman, 1992). We suggest for future studies to consider 
conducting a formal analysis of this phenomenon. 
Alternatively, it has been shown that atrophy of the motor cortex in 
older adults is associated with lower resting MT (List et al., 2013; 
Mimura et al., 2021; Zadey et al., 2021). These findings suggest that 
brain atrophy may be associated with an increase in cortical excitability. 
This would suggest that accounting for frontal atrophy with a higher 
stimulation intensity is more complex than simply modifying stimulation intensity solely based on measures of scalp-to-cortex dis-
tance. More research is needed to elucidate the optimal stimulation in-
tensity in GD. 
4.3. TMS number of pulses 
The total pulse count seems to influence the clinical outcome as well. 
Jorge et al. conducted two experiments, in the first one, participants 
received 12,000 total pulses over the course of the intervention, in the 
second they received 18,000. The authors found a higher response 
(39.4% versus 33.3%) and remission rate (27.3% versus 13.3%) with 
18,000 compared to 12,000 total pulses. This is in line with a recent 
study showing that increasing treatment duration, and thus total pulse 
count, leads to a concomitant increase in the proportion of participants 
who reach clinically-meaningful response (Yip et al., 2017). Worth 
noting is that most studies reviewed here, which employed a conven -
tional rTMS protocol with a figure-8 coil, under dosed in terms of pulse 
count compared to the FDA approved protocol that employed a similar 
treatment design (conventional rTMS with a figure-8 coil). If a higher 
pulse count is related to superior clinical outcome, the efficacy rates 
observed in these studies could be substantially higher if the studies had 
delivered a higher pulse count. Therefore, this highlights the importance 
for future studies to adequately dose. The issue of number of pulses 
seems particularly relevant for older adults given the evidence of 
altered, hypoactive, mechanism of plasticity with advancing age (Freitas 
et al., 2011; Pascual-Leone et al., 2011). Modulation of brain plasticity is 
thought to play a critical part in the therapeutic effects of rTMS (Hallett, 
2007). If so, a hypothesis could be formulated that in older adults, given 
hypoactive mechanisms of plasticity, rTMS would require a greater 
number of pulses and a longer treatment course than in younger patients 
to achieve efficacy. In the future, considering that the current FDA 
approved TMS protocols for depression have only shown moderate su-
periority over sham (around 10%), even among young populations 
(McClintock et al., 2018), it is pertinent to take into consideration how 
rTMS protocols can be optimized specifically for GD. 
4.4. Advantages of TMS for GD compared to electroconvulsive therapy 
(ECT) and pharmacological interventions 
TMS is generally safe and well-tolerated. Serious adverse effects 
include generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but the risk is low and appears 
to be comparable to that for antidepressant medications. By comparison 
ECT is an effective treatment for depression, but it is not tolerated by 
some patients and declined by others. Many patients experience some 
adverse cognitive effects during and after a course of ECT, including 
acute confusion, anterograde amnesia, and retrograde amnesia. How-
ever, objective tests indicate that neuropsychological impairment 
caused by ECT is generally short lived, and impaired cognition due to 
depression typically improves after a course of ECT. In addition, ECT 
does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of dementia 
(Duke, 2011; Kerner and Prudic, 2014). 
Furthermore, the mortality rate of ECT, at 0.2%, has been shown to 
be equal to control (Kaster et al., 2021). This makes ECT one of the safest 
procedures performed under general anesthesia. Serious adverse events 
are mostly related to cardiopulmonary events (Kerner and Prudic, 
2014). TMS offers a generally more favorable side effect profile than 
ECT or antidepressant medications. 
4.5. Recent advances in protocol optimization to improve TMS clinical 
efficacy within the framework of geriatric depression 
In this section, we present recent advancements in TMS protocol for 
depression and discuss their limitations in the context of GD. Our current 
understanding of the antidepressant mechanisms of TMS is still limited, 
and its therapeutic efficacy also remains sub-optimal (Herwig et al., 
2003). Overall, using current TMS protocols, 50% of patients attain D. Cappon et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Ageing Research Reviews 74 (2022) 101531
10improved depressive symptomatology, of whom half obtain remission 
(Blumberger et al., 2018; Fitzgerald, 2020 ). Consequently, current at-
tempts have sought to update the TMS protocol by improving targeting 
and dosage, and, more recently, focusing on personalizing the inter-
vention based on single patient symptomatology in the adult population. 
However, these approaches fail to consider that growing older pro-
gressively affects the anatomy and the neurochemistry of the human 
brain and these changes should be considered in the context of TMS for 
GD. For example, growing older has been linked to reduced brain size 
and weight, expanded cerebral ventricles and sulci, rarefication of the 
cerebral vasculature, deformation of neurons, and reduced synaptic 
density (Lindenberger, 2014 ). DTI studies showed that the integrity of 
white matter is also reduced in older adults compared to young adults 
(Moseley, 2002; Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2006 ). Further, the degree of 
age-related volume losses is different across regions. The prefrontal 
cortex and the hippocampus are among the regions that show consid -
erable individual differences in age-related reduction (Fjell et al., 2009 ). 
So far, no studies have yet systematically investigated how white matter 
abnormalities influence plasticity induced by TMS. All these 
brain-related changes might alter how the magnetic field generated by 
TMS reaches the brain cortex and influences treatment response. 
The following paragraph will review recent studies that advanced 
optimization of TMS protocols for depression (see Fig. 4) and discuss their limitations in the context of GD. Fox et al. (2012) have adopted 
fMRI to measure if BOLD-based resting-state functional connectivity can 
predict the clinical response to TMS. The authors found that different 
L-DLPFC stimulation sites have a different degree of connectivity with 
the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (SGC), and that these differences 
in degrees of connectivity explain variations in the clinical efficacy of 
TMS for depression. Specifically, a positive response to rTMS treatment 
was predicted by strong anticorrelation of the SGC with the stimulation 
site in the DLPFC. This study importantly highlights that different 
stimulation targets are associated with diverse levels of clinical efficacy 
due to different connectivity profiles. More specifically, it indicates that 
DLPFC sites with better clinical efficacy are more anticorrelated with the 
SGC. Altogether, this study also expands our knowledge of the physio -
logical mechanisms underlying antidepressant effects and shows 
encouragement for identifying the appropriate stimulation targets to 
optimize the clinical response of TMS treatment for depression. How-
ever, it is not obvious that this approach can be applied to GD because 
the functional connectivity between regions in the default mode 
network (DMN) is diminished (Damoiseaux et al., 2008; Grady et al., 
2006, 2010 ). This is even more important, considering that this reduc -
tion in functional connectivity correlates with age-related cognitive 
deterioration (Onoda et al., 2012 ), white-matter alterations (Coelho 
et al., 2021 ), and decreases in structural connectivity in aging (Greicius

site. i. Iseger et al. (2020) propose a crucial depression network between the DLPFC, SGC, and the Vagus Nerve. They argue that, since the DLPFC is functionally 
connected to the Vagus Nerve and the heart through the SGC, the degree to which rTMS modulates heart rate should predict how successfully the DLPFC stimulation 
is affecting the network. ii. They found that stimulating the left frontal area at given L-DLPFC locations successfully decreases heart rate after rTMS trains (Iseger 
et al., 2017 ). D. Cappon et al.

11et al., 2009; Honey et al., 2009 ). 
Building on Fox’s findings, Siddiqi et al. (2020b, 2021) identified 
specific neural networks associated with improvement in different 
clusters of depression symptomology. Subsequently, they discovered 
two distinct TMS circuit targets, one effective for decreasing dysphoric 
symptoms and another for reducing anxiety and somatic symptoms. 
Moreover, these two symptom-specific targets were distinct to active 
TMS compared with sham stimulation. This innovative approach dem-
onstrates that different clusters of depressive symptoms responded 
better to different TMS sites, thereby paving the way for symptoms 
specific TMS treatments. 
Recent advancements come also from Iseger et al. who proposed a 
novel approach to TMS stimulation targeting called Neuro-Cardiac 
Guided TMS targeting (NCG-TMS). This technique is built on the 
finding that the DLPFC and the SGC are nodes in a larger network that is 
functionally intertwined with the vagus nerve (VN), which is largely 
responsible for regulating heart rhythm (Thayer et al., 2009 ). 
Leveraging this frontal-vagal network, it has been shown that TMS to the 
DLPFC decreases heart rate (Makovac et al., 2017 ). The core idea of 
NCG-TMS is that the optimal stimulation target for rTMS depression 
treatment can be located by determining the region of the DLPFC that 
most successfully decreases heart rate, since this region of the DLPFC 
will be most strongly connected to the frontal-vagal network. The au-
thors have conducted three studies with healthy volunteers (total 
n75, (Iseger et al., 2019 , 2017, 2021 )) presenting evidence for the 
reliability of activating the DLPFC-SGC-VN network, which has been 
independently replicated by Kaur et al. (2020) . If NGC-TMS retains its 
promise when tested on a clinically depressed population, the technique 
could present itself as a reliable and cost-effective approach for locating 
the optimal DLPFC stimulation target for rTMS depression treatment. 
Williams et al. have proposed a more radical attempt to improve TMS 
protocol for depression. The authors developed and tested a new pro-
tocol called the Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation 
Therapy (SAINT) (Cole et al., 2019 ). The SAINT protocol incorporates a 
few innovative components, it consists of multiple sessions per day at 
separate intervals, applying a higher total pulse count, and improving 
targeting. The authors increased the dosage by applying multiple daily 
sessions of intermittent Theta Burst (iTBS), which is a stimulation 
paradigm that involves bursts of three TMS pulses at 50Hz, repeated at 
5Hz (Huang et al., 2005 ). Specifically, in SAINT, iTBS is administered 
for 10 sessions a day every 50min for 5 consecutive days. A total of 18, 
000 pulses/day with a total of up to 90,000 over the treatment. Which 
overall is the pulse count of a six-week course of conventional rTMS. 
The intersession intervals of 50min were chosen based on studies 
stimulating hippocampal slices showing that 50–90min has a cumula -
tive effect on synaptic strengthening and enlargement of dendrites in the 
hippocampus (Kram ˘ar et al., 2012 ). Extrapolating this knowledge to the 
DLPFC may be faulty. Further, the authors refer to previous studies 
showing improvements in clinical symptoms using iTBS on the motor 
cortex and parietal cortex. This does not necessarily warrant a gener -
alization of these findings to the frontal areas. 
Translation of this data in the context of GD is not obvious. For 
example, previous studies showed a general trend towards a decrease in 
TMS evoked motor cortex plasticity in the aged population compared to 
young adults (for review see Guerra et al., 2021 ). In this regard, Opie 
et al. (2017) demonstrated that iTBS increased M1 plasticity in young 
subjects, this wasn ’t the case for in the older group. Other studies 
measured TMS effects outside the motor cortex combining TMS with 
EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). This approach allows for 
measuring TMS effects applied on DLPFC, which is the targeted region in 
depression. It has been shown that after stimulation of DLPFC a reduc -
tion in N45 amplitude is found in older adults when comparing the re-
sults with a group of healthy controls, suggesting impaired 
glutamatergic plasticity in older adults (Noda et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, 
there is some literature that suggests that iTBS is applicable to the 
treatment of GD. Three case studies report on individual GD patients that gained clinical benefit after a course of iTBS treatment (Chatterjee 
et al., 2020; Hodzic-Santor et al., 2021; Konstantinou et al., 2020 ). 
Moreover, an open label trial with 13 GD patients found a 1/3 response 
rate and a 1/3 remission rate after 20 sessions of iTBS over 4 weeks 
(Cristancho et al., 2020 ), similar to the previously mentioned rates for 
conventional rTMS protocols (Blumberger et al., 2018; Fitzgerald, 
2020 ). More research is needed to corroborate the clinical value of iTBS 
for treatment of GD. Moreover, the authors choice to stimulate at 90% 
resting motor threshold , was based on a study investigating plasticity on 
the motor cortex on 16 healthy young adults (Nettekoven et al., 2014 ), 
but we know that ageing is related with disproportionately large frontal 
compared to motor area atrophy. All in all, it is unclear whether these 
mechanisms can translate to DLPFC stimulation, and it is also unclear if 
these apply in depressed older adults. Nevertheless, the remarkable 
remission rate of F90% reported by SAINT is superior to conventional 
rTMS protocols and needs to be replicated in a controlled design. 
5.Conclusion 
Overall, we found that TMS treatment for GD is safe, well-tolerated, 
and shows very encouraging efficacy results. We discussed the de-
terminants impacting clinical efficacy and conclude that most studies 
use different methodology, and the majority of studies adopted a pulse 
count substantially lower than what is prescribed by FDA protocol. 
Further, a lack of consistent clinical improvement among patients in-
dicates that the treatment has potential for optimization. A number of 
researchers have laid out techniques for optimizing TMS targeting, 
dosage, and treatment duration. However, the applicability of these 
techniques to treating GD must be evaluated in light of idiosyncrasies of 
the ageing brain. We suggest that future studies recognize the impor -
tance of sufficiently dosing the TMS protocol for GD and optimize pa-
rameters and interventions to the older adults.
