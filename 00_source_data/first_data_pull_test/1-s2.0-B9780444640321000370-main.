Abstract
This review presents the neurophysiologic principles and clinical applications of transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) and other related techniques of noninvasive cortical stimulation. TMS can serve variouspurposes for diagnosis or treatment. Regarding diagnosis, TMS is mainly dedicated to the recording ofmotor evoked potentials (MEPs). MEP recording allows investigation of corticospinal conduction timeand cortical motor control in clinical practice. Especially when using image-guided neuronavigationmethods, MEP recording is a reliable method to perform functional mapping of muscle representationwithin the motor cortex. Using various types of paired-pulse paradigms, TMS allows the assessment of
brain circuit excitability or plastic changes affecting these circuits. In particular, paired-pulse TMS para-
digms are able to appraise the intracortical balance between inhibitory controls mediated by GABAergicneurotransmission and excitatory controls mediated by glutamatergic neurotransmission. Finally, TMSdelivered as repetitive trains of stimulation (rTMS) may activate, inhibit, or otherwise interfere withthe activity of neuronal cortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and intensity, and brain-induced electric field configuration. Therefore by modifying brain functions, with after-effects lastingbeyond the time of stimulation, rTMS opens exciting perspectives for therapeutic applications, especiallyin the domain of depression and chronic pain syndromes.
INTRODUCTION: HIGH-VOLTAGE
TRANSCRANIAL ELECTRICAL
STIMULATION
Noninvasive brain stimulation is an increasingly growingdomain of research and development for clinical neuro-
physiology, covering various applications, such as disease
diagnosis, pathophysiologic investigation of cortical exci-tability changes, mapping of cortical function (e.g., beforebrain surgery), and therapeutics. A variety of techniquesfor transcranial brain stimulation has been proposed, usingeither electric or magnetic shocks delivered over the scalp.
In clinical neurophysiology practice, the initial objec-
tive of noninvasive cortical stimulation was to stimulate
the motor cortex to study corticospinal conduction time,
i.e., to record motor evoked potentials (MEPs). For thispurpose, high-voltage electrical stimulators (transcranialelectrical stimulation, or TES) were first used ( Merton
and Mort
on, 1980 ). They delivered brief high-voltage
single el
ectrical shocks through the scalp by means of a
couple of electrodes, one anode and one cathode (bipolarmontage). High voltage is required to cross the electric
resistance of the skull and to produce efficacious currents
into the motor cortex. The pyramidal tract axons aredirectly stimulated by high-voltage TES (at least underthe anodal electrode), as shown by spinal recording ofshort-latency D-waves as descending volleys ( Di Lazzaro
et al., 1
998). At high intensities, TES also activates intra-
cortical interneurons, l
eading to an indirect activation of
pyramidal neurons (multiple long-latency I-waves).
However, due to the high pain level that is generated at
scalp level by high-voltage shocks and the development

ulation, the clinical use of high-voltage TES has been
restricted to the monitoring of motor pathways undergeneral anesthesia, e.g., for spinal cord or aortic surgery(Macdonald, 2006 ;Deletis and Sala, 2008 ). In all other
applications, TES has been replaced by transcranialmagnetic stimulation (TMS), which was introduced byBarker et al. (1985) as a much less painful technique than
TES to activate the motor cortex.
PRINCIPLES OF TRANSCRANIAL
MAGNETIC STIMULATION
TMS is based on the scientific principle of electromag-netic induction discovered by Faraday in 1831. It con-sists of the passage of a brief current of very high
intensity (several thousand amps) in a copper wire coil,
which in turn produces a magnetic field that can reachup to about 2 T and lasts for about 100 ms. The magnetic
field pulse delivered by a stimulating coil applied on thescalp is able to pass through skull bone without beingattenuated and to generate an electric field when enteringthe brain ( Fig. 37.1 ). The intensity of the induced current
is sufficient to produce action potentials and to activate
brain networks safely and painlessly. The first TMS
machines for clinical use were built in the mid-1980s(Barker et al., 1985 ).
Various parameters modulate the geometry of the
induced electric field and thereby the nature of the neuralstructures activated by TMS. These parameters include theorientation and type of TMS coil, which can be unique(circular) or double (double-cone, figure-of-eight), andthe waveform of the magnetic pulse, which is usually
monophasic or biphasic.
Regarding coil design, large circular coils with winding
diameter of about 110 –130mm (number of windings: 14)
were first used. With this coil, the area of cortical stimu-
lation is relatively large. Therefore, double coils withsmaller diameters were designed to produce more focalactivation of the brain, such as the figure-of-eight coil(winding diameter: 75 –87mm ( /C22); number of windings:
9–10 (/C22)), e.g., for brain mapping or therapeutic appli-
cation of TMS. However, coils with smaller diameter heatup more rapidly in the case of repetitive stimulation, lead-ing to the development of static- or active-liquid orair-cooling systems. At present, a variety of coils are avail-able for different purposes ( Fig. 37.2 ), including magnetic
seizure therapy ( Cretaz et al., 2015 ), which are distin-
guished by the different geometries of induced brain
activation ( Deng et al., 2014 ).
The type of coil determines the area of stimulation,
while the pulse waveform (monophasic or biphasic)
determines the nature of the cortical circuits that areactivated in this area. When applied to the motor cortex(at least hand representation in the motor hand knob), amonophasic pulse delivered by a figure-of-eight coilwith lateromedial orientation generates mostly a direct
activation of corticospinal axons, as shown by recording

eight coil with posteroanterior orientation elicits only
I-waves ( Kaneko et al., 1996 ;Nakamura et al., 1996 )
and ev en
later I-waves with an anteroposterior orientation
(Di Lazzaro et al., 2001 ). The production of I-waves sug-
gestsa
tangential stimulation of horizontal fibers at the
surface of the precentral gyrus, leading to an indirect,transsynaptic activation of pyramidal cells. These obser-vations may be relevant for stimulation applied outside
the motor cortex, at least in the neocortex ( Amassian
and Stew
art, 2003 ).
Biphas ic
stimulations are thought to be more powerful
than monophasic stimulations, in particular to produce
MEPs in response to the stimulation of the motor cortex(Kammer et al., 2001 ). Biphasic stimulation is even the
standard 
pulse waveform used for applications of TMS
delivered as repetitive trains of stimulation (rTMS),
because of lower energy requirements ( Sommer et al.,
2006). The
most effective current induced in the brain
corres po
nds to the second phase of a biphasic stimulus
(Di Lazzaro et al., 2001 ). However, comparing studies
may be co
nfusing since the direction of the pulse wave-
form can be reversed depending on the type of magnetic
stimulator and the manufacturer ( Kammer et al., 2001 ).
Biphasi
c pulses generate a more complex pattern of neural
activation and activate a less uniform population ofneurons as compared to monophasic pulses. Therefore,monophasic pulses could be more effective than biphasicpulses to produce sustained after-effects when appliedrepetitively in the rTMS protocol ( Sommer et al., 2002 ;
Arai et al., 2005 ). For example, monophasic pulses
produce
more marked and prolonged MEP size reduction
following 1-Hz rTMS delivered to the motor cortex
(Taylor and Loo, 2007 ) and MEP enhancement following
10-HzrT
MS ( Arai et al., 2007 ). However, at present it
is not te
chnically possible to deliver prolonged rTMS pro-
tocols including several trains using monophasic mag-
netic stimuli. Modulating the magnetic pulse waveformsurely represents a way of optimizing future therapeuticapplications of rTMS.
The intensity of stimulation also frankly impacts on
TMS effects ( Lang et al., 2006 ;Todd et al., 2006 ). Actu-
ally, the depth
of penetration of the TMS pulse into the
brain is relatively low when using a standard figure-of-eight or even a circular coil. The intensity of the inducedcurrent rapidly falls with the squared distance to the siteof stimulation ( Mills et al., 1987 ). However, the induced
electric fiel d
goes deeper into the brain if stimulation
intensity increases and is able to recruit additional neural
networks. For example, when the motor cortex is stimu-
lated at high intensity using a figure-of-eight coil,D-waves arising from the axon hillock of pyramidal cellscan be elicited in addition to I-waves, even if the coil hasa posteroanterior orientation (Di Di Lazzaro et al., 1998 ).To reach much
deeper brain structures, specific coils
have been designed, such as double-cone coils (combina-tion of two large circular coils with an angle of 120degrees) or “H-coils ”(Zangen et al., 2005 )(Fig. 37.2 ).
Both TES and
TMS stimulate axons rather than cell
bodies of neurons since the latter have longer electricaltime constant and higher threshold. However, the cur-rents induced in the brain by TES and TMS have animportant directional component: axons are best stimu-
lated by a current that flows in parallel with their grand
axis. With respect to TMS, this means that stimulationoften occurs at the point where the axon bends out ofthe field and the change in electric field is the greatest(Maccabee et al., 1993 ). Because TMS acts by activating
circuits, the biological changes
provoked by TMS may
occur at a distance from the site of axonal activation,as demonstrated, for example, for the analgesic effects
of precentral gyrus stimulation ( Lefaucheur, 2016 ).
MOTOR EVOKED POTENTIALS
The main use of TMS in clinical neurophysiology is to
assess the conduction of the descending corticospinal
(or corticonuclear) pyramidal tract by recording MEPs.
The MEPs are recorded over target muscles with surfaceelectrodes and bipolar belly-tendon montage. The place-ment of the electrodes, as well as band-pass and amplifi-cation settings, are identical to those used for recordingcompound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) to distalelectrical stimulation of a peripheral motor nerve. Inpractice, MEPs are recorded to nonfocal stimulation of
the motor cortex and spinal roots (or the facial motor
nerve for the face). To stimulate the cortical representa-tion of upper limb or facial muscles over the lateral aspectof precentral gyrus convexity, a large circular coil is clas-sically used. To reach the cortical representation of lowerlimb, torso, or pelvic floor muscles in the more medialand deeper interhemispheric aspect of precentral gyrus,it is better to use a double-cone coil.
When magnetic stimulation is delivered over the
spine, it preferentially acts on nerve roots at the levelof intervertebral foramina. Except in a few special cases(Tomberg, 1995 ), the magnetic pulse cannot directly
stimulate the spinal cord
itself within the vertebral canal
because of the excitability properties of neural structures.As intraforaminal nerve roots, the facial nerve is partic-ularly excitable at the stylomastoid foramen. Therefore,
using TMS for recording MEPs, the total motor conduc-
tion time (TMCT) from the motor cortex to the targetmuscles can be divided into: (i) a “central ”motor con-
duction time (CMCT), including conduction along thepyramidal tract from the cortical (upper) motor neuronsto the lower motor neurons and the proximal part ofthe peripheral nerve (to intervertebral or stylomastoidTRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION 561foramina), and (ii) a purely “peripheral ”motor conduc-
tion time (PMCT), but assessing the peripheral nerve
at a distance of the lower motor neuron cell body. Inparticular, for lower limb or pelvic floor muscle record-ings, the relatively long pathways of lumbar and sacralspinal roots within the spinal canal (cauda equina) aretaken into account in the CMCT.
It must also be emphasized that with TMS (monopha-
sic pulses delivered by a circular coil), cortical (upper)
motor neurons are usually excited transsynaptically via
intracortical interneurons, in contrast to high-voltageTES that directly activates the corticospinal tract withinthe motor cortex. Therefore, the CMCT is longer whenusing TMS than TES, and is influenced by the level ofexcitability of cortical neurons. The CMCT decreasesover the years in children, in parallel with central nervoussystem maturation until adolescence. In adults, CMCT
has significant correlation not with age or gender but with
body height, at least for lower limb MEPs. In practice,the CMCT is calculated by subtracting the PMCT fromthe TMCT ( Fig. 37.3 ) and is very symmetrical. There-
fore, the observation of between-side CMCT differencesmay be clinically meaningful.
Two remarks should be made about the PMCT. First,
root stimulation can be performed using TMS (placing
the coil over the spine), but also using electrical stimu-
lation, e.g., with a high-voltage TES device (placingthe cathode over the relevant root exit zone with theanode over the spine, some centimeters more rostrally).Nerve roots can also be stimulated invasively usingmonopolar needle electrodes inserted in their vicinityas a stimulating cathode. Second, there is an alternativemethod to root stimulation for measuring the PMCT,
which is based on F-wave recordings. When recorded
for the target muscle to distal electrical nerve stimulation,the F-wave latency (FWL) measures antidromic con-duction time along the motor axons to the lower motorneuron cell bodies in the anterior horn of the spine, plusthe reexcitation of the motor neuron pool (about 1ms),and then the orthodromic conduction time from the ante-rior horns to the muscle. Accordingly, the PMCT can be
estimated by taking half of the sum of FWL and the
terminal motor latency (TML) to nerve stimulation andsubtracting 1ms, i.e., (FWL+TML /C01)/2 ( Rossini et al.,
1987 ). The PMCT measured with the F-wave technique
is slightly longer than the PMCT to direct root stimulationbecause it includes the conduction time of the radicularpathways within the spinal canal from the anterior hornsto the intervertebral foramina. Therefore, it is theoretically
valuable to compare the PMCT (or CMCT) estimated
with the methods based on root stimulation or F-waverecordings to assess these intracanal radicular pathways,e.g., corresponding to the cauda equina for lumbar andsacral spinal roots. However, the major limitation of theF-wave method is that F-waves may be difficult to reliably
obtain in proximal muscles, which are targeted for MEPs.
In addition, the FWLs, even if they are satisfactorilymeasurable, provide a measure of conduction for the fast-est motor axons, which may be not those recruited bycortical or spinal TMS.
For spinal root or motor nerve TMS, the targeted mus-
cles must be at rest, but for cortical TMS and CMCTmeasurement, the targeted muscles can be voluntarily
contracted. V oluntary contraction increases the size and
shortens the latency of the MEPs because it“preactivates ”the spinal motoneuronal pools and puts

contraction also increases temporal dispersion of the
MEPs and may create difficulties in distinguishingbetween normal and abnormal recordings in patients.
However, in practice, MEPs are usually recorded
after asking the patient/subject to preactivate the targetmuscle at 10% –20% of maximum strength. For each
muscle site, four to six consecutive MEPs should berecorded during slight tonic contraction and only the
MEP with the largest amplitude should be considered.
In patients with an inability to contract the target muscle(for instance, due to severe paresis), voluntary activationof the homologous muscle of the other side or motorimagery of target muscle contraction may facilitateMEPs, but to a lesser extent than the specific contractionof the target muscle.
MEP amplitude is not a reliable index and, in partic-
ular, no normative data can be reliably used in clinicalpractice. A frank asymmetry in MEP size ( >50%) or
MEP morphology is more relevant for diagnosis. In con-trast, robust normative data can be established for MEPlatency and conduction time variables. For example, inresponse to cortical stimulation, MEP latency shouldbe less than 12ms for trapezius and deltoid muscles,15ms for biceps and triceps brachii muscles, 19ms for
forearm muscles, 24ms for hand muscles (abductor
pollicic brevis (APB) or adductor digiti minimi (ADM)muscles), 25ms for perineal muscles, 27ms for the quad-riceps, 32ms for the tibialis anterior muscle, and 45msfor foot muscles (abductor hallucis muscle). The CMCTranges between 10 and 18ms for hand and leg muscles,respectively.
Facial muscles can also be examined, but facial MEP
recording is biased by the current spread and directactivation of the facial nerve induced by the scalp stim-ulation. Therefore facial MEPs are more difficult toperform reliably than limb MEPs in clinical routine.
MEPs can be applied for the diagnosis of central
motor disorders, as well as peripheral motor disorders.For example, root stimulation can be used to showconduction block in proximal peripheral nerves. Regard-
ing central motor disorders, prolonged CMCT can be
observed in various types of myelopathies or in multiplesclerosis, for example (review in Chen et al., 2008 ).
TRIPLE STIMULATION TECHNIQUE
The MEPs obtained in response to cortical stimulationhave a larger trial-to-trial variability than the periphe-rally evoked CMAPs. This is due to intrinsic and brainstate-dependent fluctuations of corticomotor excitabilityor cortico-muscular coherence between the power andphases of EEG and EMG activities ( Keil et al., 2014 ).
Inadditi
on, MEPs to cortical stimulation, even performedat maximal stimulator output and recorded in a voluntarily
contracted muscle, are always smaller than CMAPs to
supramaximal peripheral electrical stimulation ( Rossini
etal.,19
87;Day et al., 1989 ). This is not due to the fact
that TM S
is not sufficiently powerful to recruit all cortical
motor neurons, but to a process of phase cancellation ofmotor unit potentials ( Rossini et al., 1995 ;Magistris
etal.,19 
98). Phase cancellation results from the length
of neur al
pathways between stimulation and recording
sites on one hand, and from differences in diameter andthen conduction velocity between corticospinal axonson the other hand. This results in cortically evoked MEPssignificantly less synchronized and of lower amplitudethan CMAPs to distal nerve stimulation. The impact ofconduction velocity differences between axons in theperipheral nerve segment is less critical regarding tempo-ral dispersion of MEPs in healthy subjects ( Groppa
etal.,20
12).
However, in
pathological conditions a “peripheral ”
damage (denervation of the targeted muscles) mayfrankly increase the temporal dispersion of the MEPs,whether the stimulation is performed at spinal or corticallevel. In this case, it may be difficult to ascertain theexistence of a “central ”lesion (affecting the upper motor
neurons or the corticospinal tracts) in addition to an
underlying “peripheral ”lesion. This is a particularly
important practical problem in interpreting MEP record-
ings for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS). To address this difficulty, a specific technique,called the triple stimulation technique (TST), has beendeveloped.
The TST is a collision method introduced by
Magistris et al. (1998) to“resynchronize” corticomotor
excit
ation at a “peripheral ”level and to avoid the impact
of phase cancellation. The TST can be implementedas a valuable technique of clinical neurophysiology toestimate the number of cortical motor neurons andthen to give evidence of upper motor neuronloss, e.g., in ALS.
In brief, three consecutive stimuli are delivered: the
first one over the motor cortex using TMS and the next
two on the peripheral nerve supplying the target muscle
by means of supramaximal electrical stimulation, firstdistally (close to the muscle) and then proximally (asproximally as possible) ( Fig. 37.3 ). This leads to evoking
oftwo successive ME
Ps of the same amplitude (or area)
in the absence of cortical motor lesion. Two collisionsoccur: first, between the descending volley from the cor-tical TMS pulse and the ascending antidromic volley
from the distal nerve stimulation and, then, between
the descending volley from the proximal electrical stim-ulation and the ascending antidromic volley from thedistal nerve stimulation. Proximal electrical stimulationwill produce a MEP only for the spinal motor neuronsTRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION 563that have been initially excited by the cortical TMS pulse
(Fig. 37.3 ). If some cortical neurons are not activated
by the initial TMS pulse, collision does not occur in
response to distal nerve stimulation but to proximal nervestimulation in some axons, reducing the amplitude ofthe second MEP. Thus, comparing to a control curveobtained by a triple stimulation performed only on theperipheral nerve, the reduction in MEP amplitude pro-duced by TST reliably measures the loss of recruitable
cortical (upper) motor neurons.
OTHER SPECIFIC MEP CONDUCTION
TECHNIQUES
Using specific coils, neural structures such as the brain-
stem or the cauda equina and conus medullaris can beinvestigated. First, a double-cone coil can be placedover the inion or the midpoint between the inion andthe ipsilateral mastoid process to induce upward currentinto the brainstem ( Fig. 37.3 ) to activate the corticospinal
tracts at the pyramidal decussation within the foramenmagnum ( Ugawa et al., 1994 ). Brainstem stimulation
can be used to calculate a cortical –brainstem conduction
time and a brainstem –spinal root conduction time and
make the diagnosis of corticospinal tract lesion aboveor below the pyramidal decussation level ( Ugawa
et al., 1996 ). For cauda equina and conus medullaris
stimulation, a 20-cm diameter circular coil has been
developed to produce Magnetic Augmented Translum-
bosacral Stimulation (MATS) ( Fig. 37.3 ), in order to
distinguish between cortico-conus and cauda equinamotor conduction times with MEP recordings in legmuscles ( Matsumoto et al., 2009 ). This method could
be very useful to identify lesions affecting the caudaequina within the spinal canal, but unfortunately is notwidely available in routine practice.
MOTOR CORTICAL MAPPING
TMS can be used to map functional cortical representa-
tions of muscles, based on MEP recordings. Stimulation
is delivered with a figure-of-eight coil at various scalpsites and a fixed intensity above the rest motor threshold(cf.“Motor Threshold ”section). The amplitudes of the
MEPs evoked in muscles contralateral to the stimulationare measured. Then, a map of the scalp sites from whichresponses are obtained can be delineated for each muscleof interest. TMS cortical mapping can provide several
variables, such as the area and position of the motor
map (to compare to normal values), the motor hotspotlocation (scalp site from which MEP amplitude has amaximum value), and the center of gravity (CoG) ofthe map (scalp site corresponding to the mean locationof the weighted relative distribution of MEP size overthe map area). The CoG provides a weighted center of
the motor function, which may be more representative
than the hotspot.
TMS maps are rather accurate, as highlighted, for
instance, by the nonoverlapping representation of theabductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi(ADM) muscles (the APB representation being morelateral than the ADM one). In addition, motor maps arequite symmetrical and any asymmetry can reveal monohe-
mispheric lesion or plasticity changes (e.g., poststroke
adaptive plasticity) affecting the motor system. Finally,TMS mapping of cortical motor function can be usedfor presurgical assessment and has been validated forthis purpose in patients with brain tumors in the rolandicregion ( Lefaucheur and Picht, 2016 ). However, these
maps can be modified by various technical factors, suchas changing coil orientation or stimulation intensity, for
example. It is also important to keep in mind that any
change in spinal cord excitability may also have an impact,as for any technique based on MEP recordings.
In practice, motor mapping can be performed using a
grid drawn on a Lycra swim cap placed on the scalp(Thickbroom et al., 1999 ) or a navigation system with
dedicated software, integrating individual brain imagingdata ( Fig. 37.4 ).

cortical mapping using neurona vigated transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) technique, and robotic arms for TMS
practice.564 J.-P. LEFAUCHEURPRINCIPLES OF NEURONAVIGATION
A common method to identify a brain area relates to the
effects produced by its stimulation. Examples of corticalfunctional localization include the production of move-ments following precentral gyrus stimulation, speecharrest following left frontal stimulation ( Pascual-Leone
etal., 1991 ),or
phosphenes following occipital cortex
stimulation ( Amassian
et al., 1998 ). Another strategy is
to use the depicted
correlations between scalp locations
and underlying brain structures according to the Inter-national 10 –20 system of EEG electrode placement.
However, this technique does not take into accountinter- and intraindividual variability of cortical anatomy.
Therefore, for mapping procedures or when the same
target brain area has to be stimulated in follow-up ses-sions, an accurate localization of specific brain areas to
stimulate requires a precise online matching system
between the orientation of the coil on the scalp and thesite of stimulation. Introduced some years ago, dedicatednavigation systems integrating individual brain imagingdata serve these objectives ( Lefaucheur, 2010 ): (i) to
deter mine the exact
cortical location of a TMS target;
(ii) to ensure the reproducibility of TMS targeting duringrepeated sessions or follow-up studies; (iii) to improve
the accuracy of TMS motor mapping methods; (iv) to
determine the functional involvement of a cortical region(in motor ability or speech, as examples), especially inthe context of presurgical mapping.
The frameless stereotaxic neuronavigation system
combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data withTMS, guiding the coil to regions selected on the MRimages ( Herwig et al., 2001b, 2002 ). Stereotaxic neuro-
navigat
ion is usually based on individual structural
(anatomical) or functional MRI but can also be performedon averaged neuroimaging data or brain model taken fromthe literature or dedicated databases. The subject ’sh e a d
and the MRI slices are coregistered in a common refe-rence space using a set of anatomical landmarks (suchas the nasion or ear tragi), allowing a virtual linkagebetween MRI reconstruction and real anatomy for a
three-dimensional (3D) interactive visual navigation. An
optical-tracking system uses a camera to determine inreal-time the spatial locations of specific trackers on thecoil and subject ’sh e a d( Fig. 37.4 ). Therefore, this system
allows m
onitoring of coil position and subject ’sh e a d
movements for maintaining the accuracy of cortical target-ing during a TMS session. Navigation ensures targetingaccuracy on the order of a few millimeters, compared
with some centimeters for a nonnavigated technique
(Sparing et al., 2008 ). Moreover, the trial-to-trial coil
replace
ment variability is reduced to close to zero. Such
systems are particularly useful to target cortical regionsother than the motor cortical region (for which MEPrecording provides a reliable marker for targeting), such
as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( Herwig et al.,
2001a;Ahd 
ab et al., 2010 ;Mylius et al., 2013 ). In combi-
nation
with navigation systems, robotic arms dedicated to
the practice of rTMS can be used ( Fig. 37.4 ). Robotized
rTMS al
lows further increase in the reliability and repeat-
ability of the procedure in the context of long-term treat-
ment based on multiple sessions ( Quesada et al., 2018 ).
MOTOR THRESHOLD
In most applications and studies, the intensity of TMSis individually adjusted to the rest motor threshold(RMT), defined as the minimal intensity of a TMS pulsedelivered to the motor cortex to elicit a reliable MEP ofminimal amplitude ( >50mV) in a target muscle at rest.
Complete muscle relaxation can be controlled by check-
ing the absence of EMG at high-gain amplification,
either visually or by acoustic feedback or by both. Inplace of MEP recording, the RMTcan also be determinedon visual inspection of muscle twitches evoked by thestimulation. This “visual ”method is easier to perform
than the method based on MEP recording, but is associ-ated with a greater variability and results in about 10%higher RMT values ( Westin et al., 2014 ). An active
motor threshold (AMT )
can also be determined during
a slight tonic contraction of the target muscle at approx-imately 20% of the maximal voluntary contractionforce. The AMT corresponds to faster conducting axonsof the corticospinal tract.
When using a figure-of-eight coil, its orientation and
then the direction of the current flow induced in the brainis of critical importance for RMT determination
(Kammer et al., 2001 ;Weyh et al., 2005 ). In any case,
thelowest thresholds are
found for hand muscles.
The procedure for RMT/AMT measurement using a
figure-of-eight coil has been well defined ( Groppa et al.,
2012;Rossi
ni et al., 2015 ). First, the “hot sp ot”i s deter-
mined by stimulating the motor cortex with a fixed and
relatively high intensity contralateral to the MEP record-ing side and orienting the coil 45 degrees away from
the interhemispheric midline with the handle backwards.
Second, at the hot spot, stimulation intensity is decreasedto approximately 35% of the maximal stimulator output(MSO) and then gradually increased in steps of 5%MSO until TMS consistently evokes MEPs with peak-to-peak amplitude of more than 50 mV in the target muscle
at rest (200 mVin the case of actively contracted muscle) in
each trial. Thereafter, stimulation intensity is gradually
lowered in steps of 1% MSO until less than 5 positive
response MEPs /C2150mVf o rR M T( /C21200mV for AMT)
out of 10 trials are recorded. This stimulation intensityis then defined as the RMT (or AMT).TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION 565Adaptive methods based on threshold-tracking algo-
rithms have also been proposed ( Awiszus, 2003 ). They
may provide a
more accurate estimation of RMT with
a smaller number of stimuli compared to the “classic ”
method ( Awiszus, 2011 ;Qi et al., 2011 ). Adaptive
methods use an
S-shaped function to model the relation-
ship between TMS intensity and the probability of
eliciting an MEP. Examples of adaptive methods includeparameter estimation by sequential testing (PEST)
(Awiszus, 2003 ) and the maximum-likelihood regression
track ing algorithm (Mishory
et al., 2004 ).
INPUT –OUTPUT (STIMULUS –
RESPONSE) CURVE
The stimulus –response relationship between TMS inten-
sity and MEP amplitude can be determined by recording
MEPs at gradually increasing intensity level, e.g., by stepsof 10% increments from the RMT to 100% of MSO.Plotting MEP amplitude as a function of TMS intensity
provides a stimulus –response curve (input –output (IO)
curve), which has a sigmoid shape ( Fig. 37.5 ) and can
befitted
, e.g., to a Boltzmann function ( Devanne et al.,
1997 ). The
first segment of the curve deviates from zero
at the RM
T (if assessed in a target muscle at rest). The sec-
ond part of the sigmoid curve is an approximately linear
ascending slope caused by an increase in MEP amplitudewith increasing stimulation intensity (especially between
120% and 140% of RMT). A spectroscopy study revealed
a positive correlation between this slope and corticalglutamate levels in the motor cortex ( Stagg et al., 2011 ).
The thi
rd segment of the IO curve is a plateau with no
further increase in MEP amplitude despite increasingstimulation intensity, partly due to a phenomenon of phasecancellation of motor unit potentials.
Any change in corticospinal excitability, e.g., related to
voluntary contraction, motor learning, training, disease-related loss of corticospinal neurones, or medications,may result in a rightward or leftward shift of the curveand/or a change in its slope. This is the reason why thissensitive testing is widely used as a TMS technique ofinvestigation in neurophysiologic practice.
CORTICOSPINAL SILENT PERIOD
AND IPSILATERAL SILENT PERIOD
When recorded in a tonically contracted muscle, a MEP
produced by a TMS pulse delivered to the contra-
lateral motor cortex is always immediately followed bya period of electrical silence. This silence has a mixedcortical and spinal origin (corticospinal silent period,CSP). Spinal mechanisms are involved in the earlypart of the CSP, i.e., about the first 50ms ( Fuhr et al.,
1991 ), while the later part of the CSP takes its origininintracortical inhi
bitory controls of the motor cortex
with gamma-ami nobutyric (GABA) mediation, involving
mostly type B receptors ( Siebner et al., 1998; Stetkarova
and Kofle
r, 2013 ), particularly at high intensity of stimula-
tion ( Kimiskidis et
al., 2006). On the whole, the CSP lasts
for up t
o 100 –300ms and its duration gradually increases
with TMS intensity up to a plateau ( Kimiskidis et al.,
2005).In
contrast, the level of muscle contraction plays
an in
significant role in CSP duration ( Inghilleri et al.,
1993)(Fig. 37.5 ).
TheCSP
is more
usually measured from the onset
of the MEP than from the end of the MEP, while theend of the CSP is always set at the recurrence of volun-tary tonic EMG activity. Measurement may be facilitatedby averaging five or six rectified EMG traces ( Groppa
etal., 2012 ).
The interhemispheric difference
in CSP duration is
very small, typically less than 10ms, but interindividualdifferences as well as the intersession variability of theCSP duration are much larger, ranging between 20%and 35% ( Cicinelli et al., 1997 ;Orth and Rothwell,
2004 ). In addition, the duration of the CSP is not always
easy to deter mine,
making this parameter difficult to
use reliably in clinical routine.
The CSP is usually assessed when recording MEPs in
a tonically contracted target muscle in response to focalTMS over the contralateral motor cortex. However, aninterruption of ongoing voluntary EMG activity canalso be observed in response to ipsilateral motor cortexstimulation, known as the ipsilateral silent period (iSP)(Ferbert et al., 1992 ;Meyer et al., 1995 ). This iSP is
clearly smaller and
more difficult to obtain than the
CSP, and results from transcallosal projections of inhib-
itory controls between both motor cortices. Therefore,
the recording of iSP has been proposed as a neurophys-iologic tool for the diagnosis of corpus callosum lesions(Meyer et al., 1999 ).
PAIRED-PULSE TMS
Paired-pulse TMS techniques allow testing of variousneural circuits involved in intracortical inhibition orfacilitation. These techniques comprise a conditioningstimulus (CS) followed by a test stimulus (TS) with avariable interstimuli interval (ISI) between the CS andthe TS. Then, the amplitude of the MEP produced bythe paired pulse is compared to that produced by the
TS alone. Due to the trial-to-trial variability of MEP pro-
duced by TMS pulses, at least 8 –10 trials should be
averaged at each ISI to obtain reliable values. The studiesare usually done with the target muscle at rest, ascer-tained by monitoring background EMG activity. Musclecontraction strongly modifies paired-pulse TMS findings(Ridding et al., 1995 ).566 J.-P.LEF

and intracortical facilitation
In these paradigms, a paired-pulse is delivered to the
motor cortex, usually with a figure-of-eight coil, withMEP recording in a muscle, usually at the hand (e.g., firstdorsal interosseus muscle), contralateral to the stimula-tion. However, the technique can be performed withother types of coil (circular, double-cone) and MEPrecordings in other muscles (e.g., lower limb muscles).
In any case, the intensity of stimulation is set at 80%
of RMT for the CS and at 120% of RMT for the TS.Alternatively, the intensity of stimulation for the TScan be adjusted to produce a MEP of 1mV amplitude.The subthreshold CS pulse is able to recruit varioustypes of intracortical control circuits, both inhibitory(GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic). If the resultof the GABA/glutamate balance provided by the CS pulse
is inhibitory, the amplitude of the MEP evoked by the TS
is smaller than following the TS alone. If the result of theGABA/glutamate balance provided by the CS pulse isexcitatory, the amplitude of the MEP evoked by the TSis greater than following the TS alone. In practice,paired-pulse TMS results in MEP inhibition for an ISIbetween CS and TS ranging from 1 to 6ms (short-intervalintracortical inhibition, SICI) and in MEP excitation for
an ISI ranging between 7 and 20ms (intracortical facili-
tation, ICF) ( Kujirai et al., 1993 )(Fig. 37.5 ).
Rega rding SICI at
very short ISI (1ms), neuronal
refractoriness can be partly involved in the inhibitoryphenomenon, but for ISI longer than 2ms, MEP sizereduction clearly reflects a process of synaptic inhibitionmediated by GABA type A receptors ( Ziemann et al.,
1996 ;Di Lazzaro et al., 2007 ). However, the SICI is
influen ced by the
intensity of stimulation used for the
CS. Intracortical GABAergic circuits have a lowerthreshold than glutamatergic circuits ( Ilic et al., 2002 )
andtherefore incre asing 
the CS intensity leads to greater
SICI and then to an eventual MEP facilitation, as shownby the short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF)
paradigm (see next chapter). In fact, the relationship
between the degree of SICI and CS intensity is a variableU-shaped curve, not easily predicted in all subjects ( Chen
etal., 1998 ).In 
routine practice, SICI appears as a very
constant and reliable phenom
enon, easy to record in all
normal subjects, whereas ICF is more inconsistent andvariable in amplitude in the population.
Short interval intracortical facilitation
Paired-pulse TMS with short ISI (less than 6ms) can
produce an increase in MEP size (SICF as defined in
the previous section) if the CS is delivered at a suprathres-hold intensity of stimulation, followed by a TS deliveredat a suprathreshold intensity similar to CS ( Tokimura
etal.,19
96) or just at the RMT level, preferentially
(Ziemann et al., 1998 ). SICF occurs at three ISIs at around
1.5, 3, an
d 4.5ms ( Ziemann et al., 1998 ;Chen and Garg,
2000 ), like
ly due to the summation of different I-waves at
cortic al
level, and then to an increase in the strength of the
descending corticospinal volley ( Hanajima et al., 2002 ).
Fore
ach individual, the SICF should be assessed by
testing various ISIs from 1 to 5ms by steps of 0.2ms toidentify the optimal ISI for each SICF peak.
Long interval intracortical inhibition
and late cortical disinhibition
This paradigm requires paired-pulse TMS with both CSand TS performed at the same suprathreshold intensity of
stimulation with ISI ranging from 50 to 200ms. In con-
trast to SICI, ICF, or SICF, the paired-pulse produces notone but two MEPs. The test compares the amplitude ofthe first MEP evoked by the CS to that evoked by theTS. Using this technique, a reduction of MEP amplitudeto TS vs. CS is normally observed, called long-intervalintracortical inhibition (LICI) ( Valls-Sol /C19eet al., 1992 ;
Wassermann
et al., 1996 ;Sanger et al., 2001 ). The exact

coil over the cerebellum, lateral to the inion at 95% of the active motor threshold (AMT) and a TS applied with a figure-of-eightcoil to contralateral M1 at an intensity producing MEPs of 0.5mV amplitude with MEP recording at the hand; paired-pulseparadigms of short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), resulting from subthreshold

one individual to another, but for a quick assessment,
only two ISIs of 100 and 150ms may be used. FollowingLICI, at ISIs longer than 200ms, a period of late MEPfacilitation, called late cortical disinhibition (LCD),has been described ( Cash et al., 2010 ), preferentially if
MEP s are record
ed in voluntary contracted muscles
(Caux-Dedeystère et al., 2014 ).
Interhemispheric inhibition and facilitation
In contrast to all the previously described variables (SICI,ICF, SICF, LICI, LCD), interhemispheric modulation istested by applying the two TMS pulses at different corticalsites and not at the same site. Therefore, interhemispherictesting requires two figure-of-eight coils placed over both
motor cortices, one coil delivering the suprathreshold
CS to one motor cortex, followed by a suprathresholdTS over the contralateral one ( Fig. 37.5 ). The resulting
effectof
the paired pulse (compared to the TS alone)
varies with the ISI, MEP inhibition (interhemisphericinhibition, IHI, max /C050%) being more pronounced at
ISI of about 8 –10ms and 40 –50ms, referred to as short-
and long-latency IHI (SIHI and LIHI) ( Chen et al.,
2003;Niet 
al., 2009 ). At shorter ISIs (4 –6ms), a mild
interhemispheric facilitation (IHF, max +15%) can beobserved ( Hanajima et al., 2001 ;B€aumer et al., 2006 ).
Both SIHI and I 
HF are cortical phenomena, pro-
duced by transcallosal projections between the twomotor cortices ( Ferbert et al., 1992 ;Wahl et al., 2007 ;
Ni et al., 2009). In contrast, LIHI may represent awide spread in hib
itory system projecting from various
cortical areas, including the dorsolateral prefrontal, dor-sal premotor, and somatosensory cortices, to the motorcortex ( Ni et al., 2009 ). Interhemispheric facilitation
from the p remot
or cortex to primary motor cortex has
also been demonstrated ( B€aumer et al., 2006 ).
Short latency and long latency
afferent inhibition
The electrical stimulation of a cutaneous sensory ormixed peripheral nerve can be applied as CS precedinga subsequent suprathreshold TMS of the contralateralmotor cortex as TS. The electrical CS usually deliveredat the level of the hand or the fingers can modulate theamplitude of the MEPs recorded in the homotopic handregion ( Fig. 37.5 ). The intensity of sensory stimulation
may be set at
two to three times sensory threshold
(Ni et al., 2011 ). This type of paired associative stimula-
tion results in MEP
inhibition, according to two distinct
periods. A first period of inhibition is observed for ISIsranging between 20 and 25ms (short-latency afferentinhibition, SAI, max /C030%). In fact, the optimal ISI cor-
responds to the latency of the main cortical component ofthe somatosensory evoked potentials produced by the CS
(N20) plus 2ms ( Mariorenzi et al., 1991 ;Bikmullina
etal., 2009 ;Ni et
al., 2011). Pharmacological studies
showed that SAI invol
ves mainly cholinergic circuits
(Di Lazzaro et al., 2000 ), but also some mediation from
GABA type A receptors
(Di Lazzaro et al., 2005 ).
A second perio d
of inhibition is observed for ISIs
around 200ms (long-latency afferent inhibition, LAI,
max/C050%) ( Chen et al., 1999 ). Between these two
periods of inhib ition,
the peripheral stimulation may
result in a period of MEP facilitation, likely related tothe production of long-latency transcortical responses(Mariorenzi et al., 1991 ;Tokimura et al., 2000 ).
Cerebello-thalamo-cortical motor inhibition
A TMS pulse delivered over the cerebellum as CSmay produce a reduction in MEP amplitude in responseto a subsequent TS delivered over the primary motorcortex (cerebello-thalamo-cortical motor inhibition,
CTCI). While primary motor cortex stimulation requires
a figure-of-eight coil, cerebellar should be preferentiallyperformed with a type of coil (double-cone coil) dedi-cated to this use, placed 3cm lateral to the inion, andoriented upwards ( Ugawa et al., 1995 ;Werhahn et al.,
1996 )(Fig. 37.5 ). The CS intensity is set at 5% below
theAMT and
the TS intensity is adjusted to produce
MEP of about 0.5mV amplitude in hand muscle.
A maximal MEP inhibition (max /C040%) is observed
for ISIs between cerebellar CS and cortical TS ranging
from 5 to 8ms. For shorter ISIs (3ms), a facilitationmay occur.
This inhibitory phenomenon is thought to be medi-
ated by the activation of Purkinje cells in the cerebellarhemispheres, which leads to inhibiting pyramidal cellsin the primary motor cortex via a di-synaptic pathway
through relays in deep cerebellar nuclei (e.g., the dentate
nucleus) and the ventral lateral thalamus ( Ugawa et al.,
1995 ;Pinto and Chen, 2001 ;Groiss and Ugawa, 2012 ).
REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL
MAGNETIC STIMULATION
Repetitive TMS (rTMS) was introduced in the early1990s and required a specific set of stimulators able toovercome the recharging time of magnetic stimulatorsto maintain the same output level, even with extremely
brief ISIs. Repetitive TMS has a modulatory effect on
cortical excitability, which outlasts the stimulationperiod and can be used in a variety of indications, deliv-ered to either motor or nonmotor brain regions. Theimpact of rTMS can be observed at the site of stimulationand mostly at a distance, according to the nature of theactivated neural circuits. An international consensusTRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION 569group has provided safety recommendations for the
use of various forms of rTMS in various indications
(Rossi et al., 2009 ).
There are two classic paradigms of rTMS: low-
frequency rTMS (1Hz or less), consisting of continuoustrains of single pulses, and high-frequency rTMS (5Hzand higher), consisting of bursts of stimuli that usuallylast for 5 –10s and are separated by pauses of 20 –50s
(Fig. 37.6 ). In most therapeutic trials, the total duration
of one rTMS session is about 20min. Functional or clin-ical effects outlast the period of stimulation for minutesor hours, likely due to long-term depression (LTD) ofsynaptic transmission for low-frequency rTMS andlong-term potentiation (LTP) for high-frequency rTMS(Chen et al., 1997 ;Pascual-Leone et al., 1998 ;Post
et al., 1999 ). When applied to the motor cortex, low-
frequency rTMS is able to reduce MEP size ( Chen
et al., 1997 ), while the reverse is produced by high-
frequency rTMS ( Pascual-Leone et al., 1994 ). However,
it cannot be assumed from these MEP size changes thatlow- or high-frequency rTMS effects are due to the LTDor LTP process in all rTMS applications. Indeed, thedirection of excitability changes induced by rTMS mayvary according to the location of the cortical target(primary motor cortex versus other cortical areas) and
to the prior state of activation of the recruited brain cir-
cuits. For example, whereas a majority of studies havereported a decrease in SICI following a high-frequencyrTMS procedure in healthy subjects, a paradoxical SICIincrease can be observed in pathological conditions,especially in patients with reduced SICI at baseline(Lefaucheur et al., 2006 ). Similarly, the effect of low-
frequency rTMS on SICI or CSP is not consistent withhighly contradictory effects reported across studies(Fitzgerald et al., 2006 ).
The repetition of the sessions can reinforce and pro-
long rTMS after-effects that are often weak, variable,and short-lasting following a single session, openingperspectives for the therapeutic use of rTMS. The thera-peutic potential of rTMS was mainly demonstrated for
chronic pain syndrome and depression ( Lefaucheur
et al., 2014). Beside these classic rTMS procedures, other
TMS protocols have the potential to modulate corticalactivities at a therapeutic level ( Lefaucheur, 2009 ). The
main protocols used so far are theta burst stimula-tion (TBS), quadripulse stimulation (QPS), and pairedassociative stimulation (PAS) ( Fig. 37.6 ).
THETA BURST STIMULATION
TBS consists of short bursts of three low-intensity pulseswith inner high frequency (50Hz, within the gamma
range) that are delivered every 200ms, i.e., at 5Hz (within
the theta range) ( Fig. 37.6 ). However, TBS protocols may
vary across studies. For example, TBS delivered to thefrontal eye field to modulate saccades ( Nyffeler et al.,
2006 ;Hubl et al., 2008 ;Schindler et al., 2008 )c o n s i s t e d
of three pulses at 30Hz repeated at intervals of 100ms(10Hz).
Animal experiments suggest that TBS protocols can
produce sustained changes in long-term synaptic excit-ability ( Larson et al., 1986). When applied over the motor
Fig. 37.6. Main protocols of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), including “classic” tonic low-frequency rTMS
(/C201 Hz) and phasic high-frequency rTMS (5 –20Hz) paradigms, paired-associative stimulation (combining distal nerve peripheral
electrical stimulation and magnetic cortical stimulation), and theta burst stimulation (intermittent application of short trains of
three pulses at 50Hz delivered every 200ms, i.e., at 5 Hz, within the theta range). Partially adapted from Lefaucheur JP.(2009). Methods of therapeutic cortical stimulation. Neurophysiol Clin 39: 1–14.570 J.-P. LEFAUCHEURcortex, an “intermittent ”TBS protocol (iTBS; 2s every
10s, for a total stimulation time of 200s) can result in
MEP facilitation, whereas the continuous application ofTBS (cTBS) for 40s can result in MEP inhibition(Huang et al., 2005 ). Excitatory effects of iTBS build up
within
1s, whereas inhibitory effects of cTBS occur with
a delay of several seconds and less consistency than theeffects of iTBS. However, this dichotomy between“excitatory ”iTBS versus “inhibitory ”cTBS is not entirely
satisfying, since, for example, doubling the duration ofstimulation can reverse the effect produced by cTBSfrom inhibitory to excitatory ( Gamboa et al., 2010 ). In
additio
n, several studies reported similar rather than
opposing physiologic and clinical effects of both typesof TBS protocols when applied to motor or especiallynonmotor cortical regions ( Koch et al., 2005 ;Poreisz
etal.,20
08;Grossheinrich et al., 2009 ;Borckardt et al.,
2011;Lef
aucheur et al., 2012 ).
However, one importan
t point is that TBS protocols,
despite their extremely short duration, may producegreater and less variable effects on motor cortex excit-ability than conventional 1-Hz/10-Hz rTMS protocols(Huang et al., 2005 ). This can have a great impact on
thepractical aspects
of using rTMS for therapeutic
applications in clinical routine.
QUADRIPULSE MAGNETIC
STIMULATION
QPS has been proposed to induce long-term effects on cor-tical excitability and plasticity with less interindividualvariability ( Hamada et al., 2008 ;Nakatani-Enomoto
etal.,20
12). This technique consists of trains of four
monophas
ic TMS pulses delivered repetitively for a rela-
tively long session duration (30min). When deliveredover the motor cortex, QPS facilitates MEPs when the fourmonophasic TMS pulses are separated by an ISI of1.5–10ms (usually 5ms, QPS-5) and suppresses MEPs
for an ISI of 30 –100ms (usually 50ms, QPS-50)
(Hamada et al., 2008 ). The ISI between two trains is set
at5s (l
ow stimulation frequency of 0.2Hz) and then a
“classic ”QPS session delivers 360 trains of 4 pulses
(1440 pulses). Although QPS is thought to be an effectiveapproach to producing long-lasting cortical excitabilitychanges and sustained clinical effects, this method wasrather rarely used, especially for therapeutic purposes.Indeed, QPS requires a very specific device combiningfour magnetic stimulators connected with a specially
designed synchronizing module.
PAIRED ASSOCIATIVE STIMULATION
Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is the association
between a single electrical stimulus delivered at periph-eral level (over a sensory or mixed nerve) and a singleTMS pulse delivered over the contralateral motor cortex
(Stefan et al., 2000 ). The two stimuli are separated by a
fixed ISI to generate 
approximately synchronous events
within the primary motor cortex, i.e., about 20 –25ms for
a CS delivered to the median nerve at the wrist
(Fig. 37.6 ). When this paired stimulation is applied at
lowfrequency (0.02 –0.1
Hz) for about 30min (usually
90–180 stimuli), this leads to increased MEP amplitude
lasting up to 60min after the intervention ( Stefan
etal.,20
00). The repetition of a PAS protocol for 3 days
induces a strong expansi
on of the cortical represen-
tation of the stimulated muscle that persists for at least2 days beyond the last stimulation session ( McKay
etal., 2002 ).When 
applied at 5Hz, PAS also induces
long-lasting somatotopic incre
ase in corticospinal excit-
ability ( Quartarone et al., 2006 ).
PAS effects can
be blocked by N-methyl- D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor antagonist, arguing for LTP-likephenomenon ( Stefan et al., 2002 ). PAS can promote
adaptive plasticity and 
functional reorganization of the
motor cortex after brain injury, as shown in poststrokechronic hemiplegics ( Uy et al., 2003 ). In this latter study,
electrica l stimul ation 
of the common peroneal nerve at
the leg was associated with single-pulse TMS deliveredto the primary motor cortex corresponding to the lower
limbs. Following 4 weeks of PAS, a significant clinical
improvement was observed on several measurements.
TMS-EEG COREGISTRATION
AND CLOSED-LOOP TMS
A promising tool of functional neuroimaging techniqueis to perform coregistration of EEG activity and TMS,thus providing the possibility to assess TMS-inducedchanges in cortical excitability and on-line connectivity(Ilmoniemi et al., 1997 ;Virtanen et al., 1999 ;Ilmoniemi
and Kiči/C19c,
2010 ). This means that the impact of TMS-
evoke d
neuronal activation can be appraised on scalp
EEG activity changes and turned into a source of cerebral
imaging. Although difficult to record without artifact
contamination, several EEG responses to single-pulseTMS delivered over the motor cortex have been identi-fied, i.e., negative and positive peaks whose latency rangesfrom 7 to 300ms following a TMS pulse ( Ilmoniemi and
Kiči/C19c,201
0;Ferreri and Rossini, 2013 ). In addition, TMS
pulse s
may modulate oscillatory brain rhythms and trig-
ger event-related EEG synchronization/desynchronization
or complex phenomena. A better knowledge of brain
connectivity based on high-resolution EEG or diffusiontensor imaging studies could benefit the understandingof TMS-evoked EEG responses. Both local and distanteffects of TMS can be obtained, even in contralateral hemi-sphere, via transcallosal connections ( Ilmoniemi and
Kiči/C19c,201
0;Ferreri and Rossini, 2013 ). The impact ofTRANSCRANIAL MA
GNETIC STIMULATION 571TMS on EEG response is also modulated by the initial
state of the activated brain region ( Ferrarelli et al., 2008 ;
Casarotto et al., 2010 ;Karabanov et al., 2015 ).
On the other hand,
the“brain-state ”can be considered
a critical factor regarding the possibility of inducing
optimal plastic changes in the brain. Since “brain-state ”
may be reflected by some EEG features, EEG recordingscould be used to provide biomarkers to determine thebest moment to deliver TMS for promoting cortical
plasticity. This is the principle of a closed-loop stimula-
tion, coupling TMS to an EEG feedback. In fact, variousstudies have recently shown the technical possibility ofsuch a montage, for instance delivering TMS pulses overthe motor cortex, which were triggered online by oscilla-tory brain activity recorded in a 32-channel EEG set-upduring cued kinesthetic motor imagery of hand opening(Gharabaghi et al., 2014 ). Various approaches to closed-
loop interactions can
be designed, such as a direct
coupling of TMS to instantaneous EEG activity or theuse of a “task dynamics” loop, in which goal-directed
behavioral tasks are incorporated ( Zrenner et al.,
2016 ). One problem can be to identify a reliable bio-
mark er to c 
lose the loop, with sufficient signal-to-noise
ratio and timing precision as a single trial (with no needof averaging).
TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT
STIMULATION
In addition to TMS, various techniques of transcranialelectrical stimulation are being used more and more to
perform noninvasive cortical neuromodulation in the
clinical domain. Among these techniques, transcranialdirect current stimulation (tDCS), recently reintroducedin clinical neurophysiology ( Priori et al., 1998 ;Nitsche
andPaulus, 2000 ),
is currently the most widely devel-
oped technique, a t
least regarding its therapeutic appli-
cations in a variety of neurological and psychiatricdisorders ( Lefaucheur et al., 2017 ). The usual tDCS tech-
nique consists o f 
delivering weak direct currents by a
large electrode (anode or cathode) placed on the scalpover a targeted cortical area with a return electrode ofopposed polarity placed over the contralateral forehead,the chin, or the shoulder. Beyond this “classic ”bipolar
montage, more complex electrode montages are devel-oped, including either highly focal stimulation by meansof“high-definition ”Laplacian montages ( Borckardt
etal., 2012 ) or
multifocal stimulation of various inter-
connected cortical
regions. In all cases, battery-driven
portable stimulators can be used and the delivered cur-rent is set at a fixed intensity of 1 –2mA, applied contin-
uously for 10 –20min. Currents of this magnitude cannot
directly evoke action potentials in cortical axons but pro-duce small polarizing changes in membrane potentialand sustained modulation of cortical cell excitability
(e.g., in spontaneous firing rates) that outlast the stimu-
lation period ( Filmer et al., 2014 ).
Cortical neurons hav e
an exquisite sensitivity to weak
DC fields that can produce local fluctuations in trans-membrane ionic concentrations or conductance, leadingto a variety of nonsynaptic changes ( Jefferys, 1995 ;
Ardolino et al., 2005 ). These changes can also affect glial
cells (Ruohonen and Kar
hu, 2012 ). However, the main
mechanism of acti
on of tDCS is thought to result from
plastic changes in synaptic connectivity, especially medi-ated by NMDA receptors ( Liebetanz et al., 2002 ;Nitsche
etal., 2003 ).By 
acting on neuronal networks ( Francis
et al., 2003 ),tDCS
may interfere with oscillatory brain
activities ( Marshall et
al., 2004 ).
A general opinio n
is that modulation of neuronal
excitability by DC stimulation is a relatively simple
function: cortical excitability is reduced by cathodal
stimulation and increased by anodal stimulation, due toprocesses of neuronal hyperpolarization and depolariza-tion. However, various factors can explain that in facttDCS effects are more difficult to predict.
First, the resulting effect of DC stimulation highly
depends on the orientation and distance of the axonalor dendritic-somatic axis with respect to the electric
field ( Gluckman et al., 1996 ). More recent experiments
have showed that
the spatial and temporal effects of
DC fields can be more complex than expected from
initial reports ( Bikson et al., 2004 ). Therefore, little var-
iation in the technique,
e.g., in reference electrode place-
ment or in stimulation intensity, can strongly influencethe physiologic and clinical changes provided by tDCS(Nitsche and Paulus, 2000 ;Priori, 2003 ).
Second, although weak
DC fields can coherently
depolarize or hyperpolarize a neuronal network withrespect to electrode polarity, the resulting effect of thestimulation depends on whether it affects an inhibitory(e.g., GABAergic) or excitatory (e.g., glutamatergic)brain circuit and also on the baseline activity of this net-work and its afferent synaptic inputs. All these factorscould explain the variable clinical impact of tDCS
according to the studies in pathological conditions.
Regarding the intensity of current produced into
cortical layers, tDCS cannot be compared to TMS.
Indeed, 2-mA tDCS with an anode of 25cm
2was shown
to produce a mean current density of 0.1A/m2(Miranda
et al., 20
06), whereas TMS yields current densities of
1.5–4.5A
/m2(Wagner et al., 2004 ). However, varia-
tions i
n tissue conductivity or distance between the
target and the stimulating coil or electrode can greatlyinfluence the resulting effect. In addition, the magni-tude and location of current density can be altered inpathological versus normal conditions (Wagner et al.,2006, 20 07
).572 J.-P.LEF
AUCHEUROther techniques of transcranial electrical stimula-
tion using low-intensity currents applied through scalp
electrodes have been proposed for more than a century(Limoge et al., 1999 ;Paulus, 2011; Guleyupoglu et al.,
2013 ), like nonpolarizing high-frequency pulsed bipha-
sicbalanced curren 
t, transcranial alternating stimulation
(tACS), or random noise stimulation (tRNS). Thesetechniques will not be detailed here.
NEURAL CIRCUIT ACTIVATION
BY CORTICAL STIMULATION:
SPATIAL ASPECTS
The strength-duration relationship of membrane proper-ties makes fibers of passage more excitable than local cellbodies at the stimulation site ( McIntyre and Grill, 2002 ;
Nowak and Bullier, 1998 ). Therefore, one key feature of
thera peutic brain stimulati
on is that fibers are more prone
to be activated than cell bodies. The selective activationof neuronal cell bodies should require asymmetricalcharge-balanced biphasic stimuli ( McIntyre and Grill,
2002 ), but such a pattern of stimulation is not provided
bystandard neuros
timulation techniques. The axonal
excitation can give rise to both orthodromic and anti-
dromic volleys. Orthodromic volleys induce postsyn-
aptic excitation or inhibition in cortical or subcorticaltargets, whereas antidromic volleys reach the neuralstructures from which efferents arise, resulting in colli-sion or network activation through collaterals, for exam-ple. However, both orthodromic and antidromic volleyscan modulate the same structures through reciprocalinterconnections. Although “local”effects may occur,
the neural activity changes produced by cortical stimula-tion rather locate at a distance from the site of stimulation(Lefaucheur, 2008 ). Even if the site of stimulation is not
thesite of acti
on, it must be precisely determined to allow
between-study comparability and session repeatability.This goal is achieved in particular by using navigationsystems dedicated for rTMS practice.
NEURAL CIRCUIT ACTIVATION
BY CORTICAL STIMULATION:
TEMPORAL ASPECTS
Fiber activation by cortical stimulation is able to generatevarious types of effects, developing or occurring duringor beyond the time of stimulation. On one hand, there areacute or short-lasting effects, like MEP size changes in
response to motor cortex stimulation. On the other hand,
there are delayed and long-lasting effects, like thera-peutic effects of cortical stimulation. For example, theanalgesic effects produced by motor cortex stimulationin patients with chronic pain are delayed but prolongedfor hours or days after the stimulation period usingrTMS ( Lefaucheur et al., 2001 ). This could be relatedtotime-consumi ng
neurochemical or neuroendocrine
processes, expression of secondary messengers, andsynaptic plasticity ( Padberg et al., 2003 ).
Inothe 
r types of neuromodulation, e.g., deep brain
stimulation in tremor, clinical changes occur rapidlyafter switching the stimulator “on”or“off”or after
modifying stimulation parameters. These rapid changesargue for stimulus-locked processes of activation, inhibi-tion, or modification of disease-related (de)synchroniza-
tion or oscillations, especially relevant for a closed-loop
approach of brain stimulation. A careful assessment ofthe temporal relationship between clinical changes andstimulation time can provide valuable information on themechanisms of action of a technique of neuromodu-lation. To summarize, neural changes occurring duringstimulation can result from stimulus-locked activation,inhibition, or modification of oscillatory activities in
cortico-subcortical networks. In contrast, plastic synaptic
changes are considered to govern long-lasting after-effects.
PLASTICITY AND PRIMING
Synaptic plasticity depends on firing rate, spike timing,
and temporal and spatial summations of the inputs arriv-
ing at presynaptic level. However, whether a synapse isstrengthened or weakened by presynaptic activity alsodepends upon the level of activity in the postsynapticneuron. The processes leading to depression of synaptictransmission are more effective when postsynaptic activ-ity is high. Conversely, potentiation of synaptic trans-mission is more likely when postsynaptic activity is
low. This is known as the Bienenstock– Cooper –Munro
(BCM) model ( Bienenstock et al., 1982 ). Generally
speaking, previous neurona
l activity modulates the
capacity for subsequent plastic changes. This has been
termed metaplasticity ( Abraham and Tate, 1997 ). All
these phenomena could
concur in stabilizing neuronal
networks and therefore contribute to “homeostatic
plasticity ”(Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004 ).
Astudy
showed that rTMS ef fects on intracortical
inhibition depended more on baseline individual valuesthan on stimulation frequency ( Daskalakis et al., 2006 ).
Subjects w ith 
less inhibition before rTMS tended to
have an increased inhibition post-rTMS (and vice-versa).A similar observation was made in patients with chronicpain who showed defective intracortical inhibition at base-line and increased inhibition following rTMS delivered at
10Hz over the motor cortex ( Lefaucheur et al., 2006 ).
Acco rdingly ,
priming cortical stimulation aimed at
modulating the initial state of cortical excitability could
influence subsequent rTMS-induced changes in corticalexcitability. The priming stimulation can have no detect-able effects per se on synaptic transmission. There areseveral reports of efficacious priming protocols in theTRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION 573literature: subthreshold 6-Hz rTMS was found to rein-
force the depression of motor responses induced by
suprathreshold 1-Hz rTMS subsequently applied to themotor cortex ( Iyer et al., 2003 ); the priming effect of
iTBS was asses 
sed on a subsequent 1-Hz rTMS session
delivered to temporoparietal language areas during anauditory word-detection task ( Andoh et al., 2008 ); the
analge sic eff ec 
ts of “conventional ”10-Hz rTMS deliv-
ered to M1 was found to be enhanced by TBS priming,
at least using iTBS ( Lefaucheur et al., 2012 ); a PAS ses-
sion was found to
affect the changes in motor cortex
excitability induced by a subsequent PAS session
(Muller et al., 2007 ); tDCS was found to enhance or
revers e the effects
of 1-Hz or 5-Hz rTMS depending
on stimulation polarity ( Lang et al., 2004; Siebner
etal., 2004 ),and
so on. Thus, priming cortical stimula-
tion surely is
a potent way of improving rTMS efficacy
in clinical practice.
Lesions and diseases can also be at the origin of
preexisting homeostatic changes in the activity of a givencortical region. Therefore, the effects of cortical stimula-tion and priming strategies may differ between patientsand healthy subjects. For example, PAS-induced poten-tiation of synaptic transmission is lacking in Parkinson ’s
disease ( Ueki et al., 2006 ) but enhanced in patients with
focal dystonia (writ er’s
cramp) ( Quartarone et al., 2003 )
compared to norm
al controls. Differential effects of dor-
solateral prefrontal cortical stimulation were observedbetween normal subjects and depressive patientsregarding the type of mood changes with respect to theside of stimulation ( George et al., 1996 ;Pascual-Leone
etal., 1996 ).Actuall
y, abnormal plastic responses and
altered excit ability
changes to cortical stimulation have
been found in numerous neuropsychiatric diseases.Various mechanisms other than preexisting homeostaticchanges may also explain the differences in theresponsiveness to cortical stimulation between healthysubjects and patients. These mechanisms include geneticfactors ( Edwards et al., 2006 ;Kleim et al., 2006 ),
horm onal factors (Inghiller
i et al., 2004 ), attentional
capacities ( Stefan et
al., 2004 ), interindividual differ-
ences in brain anatom
y, and possible shift of cortical
areas of interest. The latter can now be corrected bydetermining the location of cortical stimulation targetswith functional neuroimaging data integrated in a navi-gated approach.
CONCLUSION: SAFETY
AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
As a conclusion, it should be emphasized that the adverseeffects of noninvasive cortical stimulation, especiallyTMS, are rare and the contraindications sparse, ashighlighted in various guidelines ( Rossi et al., 2009 ;Lefaucheur et al., 2011 ;Antal et al., 2017 ). A mild and
transient headache can be
induced by TMS, but the main
concern is to provoke seizure during an rTMS session,even if there is no evidence that a chronic epileptic dis-order could be generated. The risk of inducing seizuredepends on the intensity and the frequency of stimulationand also on the “brain-state ”of the patient. In practice,
this risk can be limited by following the published safetyguidelines and by withdrawing drugs that reduce seizure
threshold. The possibility of hearing after-effects, mainly
hyperacusis, should also be taken into consideration,because the loud clicking sound evoked from the TMScoil may theoretically exceed limits for noise exposure.The use of hearing protection devices (earplugs) isrecommended for rTMS sessions, especially in the caseof temporal cortex stimulation. The other adverse effectsare more hypothetical, including heating of the brain and
effects on pulse rate, blood pressure, or hormone levels.
The contraindications for TMS are similar to those ofMRI, mainly involving intracranial ferromagnetic mate-rial. Cardiac pacemaker is usually considered a contrain-dication, although it is unlikely to be damaged by a TMSpulse delivered over the head.
The TMS techniques currently have a worldwide
recognition and a major place in neurophysiologic
practice, providing methods for diagnosis, pathophysio-
logic investigation, mapping procedure, or therapeuticapplications.
