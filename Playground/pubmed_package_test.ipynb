      "          \"Fever is an abnormal increase in body temperature that occurs as part of a specific biologic response mediated and controlled by the central nervous system. Despite the fact that most fevers are viral in origin, approaching a febrile child is always a concern for any physician. There is still a significant gap between current practice and scientific evidence. According to research, we are at a crossroad, with strong research evidence accumulating over the last few decades supporting a positive role for fever and the ongoing pressures of current practice to lower body temperature. Despite the fact that most pediatricians agree that treating a febrile child with antipyretics is primarily for the relief of fever symptoms, many continue to prescribe antipyretics for any child with fever, ignoring important research messages. By prescribing antipyretics to children who are only mildly febrile, pediatricians may contribute to fever phobia. We give parents the impression that fever is harmful and that antipyresis is beneficial when we focus on treating the fever. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence that is currently available regarding the management of the febrile child.\"\n",

      "TMS is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation by which a brief \n",
      "magnetic field passes through the scalp and induces an electrical current \n",
      "in the cerebral cortex. Barker et al. (1985) at the University of Sheffield, \n",
      "UK introduced the first, ‘modern-era ’ TMS device. Prior to that, explo -\n",

      "2011; Walsh and Pascual-Leone, 2003 ). The operating mechanism of a \n",
      "TMS stimulator includes a capacitive high-voltage, high-current \n",
      "charge-discharge system connected via an electronic switch (thyristor) \n",
      "to the inductor of the stimulation coil (Wagner et al., 2007 ). \n",
      "Passing a short and strong pulse of current via a coil positioned on \n",
      "the scalp generates a magnetic field that penetrates skin and skull, and \n",
      "reaches the brain where it induces electrical currents according to the \n",
      "physical principle discovered by Michael Faraday (Barker et al., 1985 ; \n",
      "Wassermann et al., 2008 ). A TMS pulse can modulate neural activity \n",
      "directly in a spatially and temporally focused manner to depolarize \n",
      "neurons, modify intracortical excitability, and activate distant \n",
      "cortical-subcortical and spinal structures along specific connections. The \n",
      "impact of a TMS pulse on the brain is dependent on several different \n",
      "factors, including the power of the magnetic flux, the shape of the \n",
      "stimulation coil, the shape and duration of the pulse, the distance and \n",
      "orientation between the coil and the cortical surface, the direction of the \n",
      "induced electrical currents, the specific repetition of electric pulses, and \n",
      "the underlying cortical structure and activity. \n",

      "interact with brain activity and behavior, for example, inducing speech \n",
