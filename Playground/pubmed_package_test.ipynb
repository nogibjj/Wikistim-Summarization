      "          \"Fever is an abnormal increase in body temperature that occurs as part of a specific biologic response mediated and controlled by the central nervous system. Despite the fact that most fevers are viral in origin, approaching a febrile child is always a concern for any physician. There is still a significant gap between current practice and scientific evidence. According to research, we are at a crossroad, with strong research evidence accumulating over the last few decades supporting a positive role for fever and the ongoing pressures of current practice to lower body temperature. Despite the fact that most pediatricians agree that treating a febrile child with antipyretics is primarily for the relief of fever symptoms, many continue to prescribe antipyretics for any child with fever, ignoring important research messages. By prescribing antipyretics to children who are only mildly febrile, pediatricians may contribute to fever phobia. We give parents the impression that fever is harmful and that antipyresis is beneficial when we focus on treating the fever. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence that is currently available regarding the management of the febrile child.\"\n",

      "stimulation (TMS) and other related techniques of noninvasive cortical stimulation. TMS can serve variouspurposes for diagnosis or treatment. Regarding diagnosis, TMS is mainly dedicated to the recording ofmotor evoked potentials (MEPs). MEP recording allows investigation of corticospinal conduction timeand cortical motor control in clinical practice. Especially when using image-guided neuronavigationmethods, MEP recording is a reliable method to perform functional mapping of muscle representationwithin the motor cortex. Using various types of paired-pulse paradigms, TMS allows the assessment of\n",
      "brain circuit excitability or plastic changes affecting these circuits. In particular, paired-pulse TMS para-\n",
      "digms are able to appraise the intracortical balance between inhibitory controls mediated by GABAergicneurotransmission and excitatory controls mediated by glutamatergic neurotransmission. Finally, TMSdelivered as repetitive trains of stimulation (rTMS) may activate, inhibit, or otherwise interfere withthe activity of neuronal cortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and intensity, and brain-induced electric field configuration. Therefore by modifying brain functions, with after-effects lastingbeyond the time of stimulation, rTMS opens exciting perspectives for therapeutic applications, especiallyin the domain of depression and chronic pain syndromes.\n",

      "which is based on F-wave recordings. When recorded\n",
      "for the target muscle to distal electrical nerve stimulation,the F-wave latency (FWL) measures antidromic con-duction time along the motor axons to the lower motorneuron cell bodies in the anterior horn of the spine, plusthe reexcitation of the motor neuron pool (about 1ms),and then the orthodromic conduction time from the ante-rior horns to the muscle. Accordingly, the PMCT can be\n",

      "valuable to compare the PMCT (or CMCT) estimated\n",
      "with the methods based on root stimulation or F-waverecordings to assess these intracanal radicular pathways,e.g., corresponding to the cauda equina for lumbar andsacral spinal roots. However, the major limitation of theF-wave method is that F-waves may be difficult to reliably\n",

      "induced by TMS, but the main\n",
      "concern is to provoke seizure during an rTMS session,even if there is no evidence that a chronic epileptic dis-order could be generated. The risk of inducing seizuredepends on the intensity and the frequency of stimulationand also on the “brain-state ”of the patient. In practice,\n",
      "this risk can be limited by following the published safetyguidelines and by withdrawing drugs that reduce seizure\n",
      "threshold. The possibility of hearing after-effects, mainly\n",
      "hyperacusis, should also be taken into consideration,because the loud clicking sound evoked from the TMScoil may theoretically exceed limits for noise exposure.The use of hearing protection devices (earplugs) isrecommended for rTMS sessions, especially in the caseof temporal cortex stimulation.
