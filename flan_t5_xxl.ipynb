Effec- tive, durable treatments have historically been elusive. Interventional therapies, such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have  shown limited efficacy at best. Recently, a novel treatment, 10\\xa0kHz SCS, has demonstrated superior pain relief compared  with traditional SCS in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In this manuscript, we report on the long-term improvements  in quality of life (QoL) outcomes for subjects enrolled in this study. Methods A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (SENZA-RCT) was conducted. Patients with both chronic  back and leg pain were enrolled and randomized (1:1) into 10\\xa0kHz SCS or traditional SCS treatment groups. A total of 171  subjects received a permanent SCS device implant. QoL and functionality measures were collected up to 12\\xa0months. The  device remote control utilization, which is an indication of patient interaction with the device for adjustments, was collected  at 24-month post-implantation. Results At 12\\xa0months, a higher proportion of 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects had marked improvement of their disability (Oswestry  Disability Index) to a âmoderateâ or âminimalâ impact on their daily function versus the control group. The subjects also  reported better improvement in the Global Assessment of Functioning, Clinician Global Impression of Change, Pittsburgh  Sleep Quality Index, and short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire, compared to traditional SCS subjects. The 10\\xa0kHz SCS  subjects also reported far higher rates of both driving and sleeping with their device turned on, as well as reduced reliance  on their programmers to adjust therapy settings. Conclusions In addition to superior pain relief, 10\\xa0kHz SCS provides long-term improvements in quality of life and func- tionality for subjects with chronic low-back and leg pain.

Chronic, intractable back pain  dramatically affects oneâs work function, activities of  daily living, as well as social relationships with friends  and family members. In addition, the global pervasive- ness and intractable nature of this ailment, as the leading  cause of disability in the population, results in tremendous  healthcare utilization [3â5] and loss of workforce produc- tivity [6, 7]. Treatments for chronic pain currently include  exercise, physical therapy, psychological support, phar- maceuticals, interventional procedures, neuromodulation,  and surgery. However, the evidence of efficacy of such  treatments is limited for many chronic pain patients [8].  Thus, there is great need for improved treatment options  for patients living with chronic low-back and leg pain, in  order to not only reduce their pain, but to also improve  their quality of life (QoL). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a well-established  treatment option for chronic neuropathic pain arising  from various etiologies [9â12]. Traditional SCS utilizes  an array of electrodes placed in the epidural space to  deliver low-frequency (â¼50\\xa0Hz) electrical stimulation to  the dorsal column nerve fibers. This therapy depends on  the induction of paresthesias (tingling or buzzing sen- sations) overlapping the patientâs pain distribution [13].  Paresthesias are caused by the activation of large diameter  AÎ² fibers [14]. While\\xa0it has been found to be an effective  treatment for chronic, intractable neuropathic pain [15,  16], published evidence demonstrates that pain relief from  traditional SCS may not be sustained over the long-term.  Moreover, traditional SCS may not effectively treat axial  low-back pain [15, 17â19]. The arrangement of dorsal  column fibers innervating the axial back makes it diffi- cult to elicit paresthesias in this region using traditional  SCS. Moreover, the intensity of these paresthesias can  also vary, based on body position resulting in either a  sudden, uncomfortable increase in stimulation or persis- tent unwanted sensations [20, 21]. This precludes the use  of traditional SCS during sleeping, driving, and operat- ing machinery. Thus, there remains great potential for  improved efficacy of neuromodulation as an attractive  alternative to both conventional medical management and  more invasive surgical procedures. Recently, a neuromodulation therapy utilizing a high- frequency, 10\\xa0kHz stimulation waveform (HF10 therapy)  has emerged as a promising therapeutic option. This  therapy involves percutaneous leads placed in the epi- dural space, similar to traditional SCS. But a combina- tion of anatomical midline lead placement and stimulation  parameters results in paresthesia-free pain relief with  10\\xa0kHz SCS. In a multicenter, randomized controlled  trial (SENZA-RCT), 10\\xa0kHz SCS demonstrated superior,  long-lasting back and leg pain relief, when compared to  traditional, low-frequency SCS without the need for pain- paresthesia overlap [22, 23]. At 12\\xa0months, the responder  rates (â¥ 50% pain relief) for the 10\\xa0kHz SCS and low- frequency SCS were 76.5% and 49.3% for back pain and  72.9% and 49.3% for leg pain, respectively. Pain relief  is the primary goal when treating subjects with chronic  pain; however, there are secondary measures that reflect  the subjectsâ overall well-being and functionality. Out- comes related to QoL, as assessed by appropriate meas- ures of functionality, sleep, pain interference, and subject  satisfaction, elucidate a more comprehensive picture of the  subjectsâ disposition [10, 15, 24â28]. We present data col- lected during the SENZA-RCT, demonstrating improved  functionality and QoL outcomes for subjects treated with  10\\xa0kHz SCS therapy. Methods This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT01609972) on May 30th, 2012 and conducted in com- pliance with the United States Code of Federal Regulations  and in accordance with recommendations of the 18th World  Medical Assembly (Helsinki, Finland) guiding physicians in  biomedical research. Both the study protocol and informed  consent were approved by each participating siteâs govern- ing institutional review board (Western Institutional Review  Board, Puyallup, Washington; Forsyth Medical Center Insti- tutional Review Board, Winston-Salem, North Carolina). All  subjects enrolled in the study provided written, informed  consent prior to their participation. A total of 198 subjects with both back and leg pain were  randomized 1:1 to either low-frequency, traditional SCS or  10\\xa0kHz SCS across ten comprehensive pain treatment cent- ers in the United States. Detailed methods, including sub- ject demographics and subject flow diagram, are described  elsewhere [29]. Briefly, a pair of percutaneous leads was  placed in the dorsal epidural space along the radiographic  midline of the spinal column and stimulation was trialed  for up to 14\\xa0days. Of the subjects randomized, 189 com- pleted the trial phase and 171 of those had a successful  trial, defined as â¥ 40% reduction in back pain as measured  by the 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). The subjects with  successful trials were implanted with a permanent SCS  system, 90 with 10\\xa0kHz SCS (Senza System; Nevro Corp.,  USA) and 81 with traditional SCS (Precision Plus System;  Boston Scientific, USA). Of\\xa0the 198 subjects (101â10\\xa0kHz,  97âlow-frequency SCS) randomized to trial stimulation,  2037 Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035â2044  1 3 a total of 9 were not trialed (4â10\\xa0kHz SCS and 5âlow- frequency SCS) for the following reasons: 10\\xa0kHz SCSâ medical contraindication (2), withdrawal of consent (1),  lost to follow-up (1); low-frequency SCSâwithdrawal of  consent (4), medical contraindication (1). Only those with  a successful trial (â¥ 40% pain relief) proceeded to perma- nent implant (10\\xa0kHz SCSâ90 or 92.8%; low-frequency  SCSâ81 or 88.0%). Under the guidance of the study investigators, SCS  devices were programmed by representatives of the respec- tive company according to their best practices. Low-back and  leg pain scores (VAS) were collected at all follow-up visits,  in addition to measures of functionality [Oswestry Disability  Index (ODI) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)],  pain interference [Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire  (SF-MPQ-2)], and sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality  Index (PSQI)]. Overall well-being [Short Form Health Sur- vey (SF-12) and Global Impression of Change (GIC)] data  were also captured at baseline and 12-month post-permanent  device implant. ODI assesses the level of disability as âminimal,â âmod- erate,â âsevere,â âcrippled,â or âbed bound,â [30] while GAF  categorizes symptoms that affect social, occupational, and  school activities as ânone,â âminimal,â âtransient,â âmild,â  âmoderate,â or âseriousâ [31]. SF-MPQ-2 measures both  neuropathic and non-neuropathic (affective) pain associated  with a disease condition [32]. GIC assesses the change in  severity of a subjectâs pain over time and involves both a  patientâs report as well as a clinicianâs evaluation [33, 34].  PSQI assesses seven subscales related to sleep that together  add up to a global score [35]. ODI has been validated in a low-back pain population  [30, 36], whereas SF-MPQ-2 was validated for use in clini- cal research with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain con- ditions [32]. SF-12 is an established, generic measure of  health status used in various disease conditions [37]. All of  the above listed questionnaires along with GIC were recom- mended health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in  chronic pain trials by the Initiative on Methods, Measure- ment and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT)  [38]. Current traditional SCS therapies can cause sudden  changes in paresthesias with activities as the position of the  stimulating electrode and spinal cord varies [39]. Frequent  interaction with the device, by changing the stimulation  or turning the therapy off to avoid unwanted shocks, may  be perceived as burdensome to patientâs normal daily rou- tine. To explore this question, subjects returning for their  24-month follow-up visit were asked how often they used  their remote programmers and whether they carried it with  them when they left the house. Also, the continuous usage  of stimulation including while sleeping and during activi- ties without having to frequently change stimulation settings  could be surrogate marker for good pain relief and quality  of life. Data are presented as the median and 95% confidence  interval (CI) of the median. In outcomes where no base- line values are available for comparison, data are presented  as median and their interquartile range (IQR).\\xa0Categorical  variables were compared using either Fisherâs exact test or  MannâWhitney test if there was evidence of non-normality  in the data. This study was powered for the primary end- point of responder rate with a hierarchical testing proce- dure performed for secondary endpoints (all of which were  determined to be significant) [29]. The quality of life out- comes reported in the current manuscript were tertiary or  observational outcomes, and therefore were not subject to  hierarchical testing. As such, we report nominal p values  without correction. Results Oswestry LowâBack Pain Disability Questionnaire  (ODI) There was no difference between the two groups in baseline  ODI scores, whether analyzing average raw scores (dif- ference in medians: 2.00 [95% CI 0.00â5.33], p = .141,  exact non-parametric MannâWhitney test, 2-sided) or dis- tribution of subjects among the subcategories (p = .228,  exact non-parametric MannâWhitney test, 2-sided). At  12\\xa0months, however, there was a notable improvement for  the 10\\xa0kHz SCS group compared with traditional SCS sub- jects in both average raw scores (difference in medians:  6.00 [95% CI 1.56â11.12], p = .016, exact non-parametric  MannâWhitney test, 2-sided) and distribution of subjects  among the subcategories (p = .010, exact non-parametric  MannâWhitney test, 2-sided) (Fig.\\xa01). Within the 10\\xa0kHz  SCS group, 69.6% of subjects had an improved ODI score  sufficient to reclassify them into a lower disability cate- gory, whereas 55.1% of traditional SCS subjects were in  a lower disability grouping at 12\\xa0months (Table\\xa01). The  specific distribution of subjects among subcategories has  been previously reported [29]. Global Assessment of\\xa0Functioning (GAF) Baseline scores were 65.00 (IQR 15.00) and 65.00 (IQR  18.25) for 10\\xa0kHz SCS and traditional SCS groups, respec- tively (difference in median: 0.00 [95% CI â 2.00â5.00],  p = .511). Improvement in GAF scores at 12\\xa0months com- pared to baseline was 14.00 (IQR 15.00) in the 10\\xa0kHz SCS  group and 6.50 (IQR 19.00) in the traditional SCS group.  Therefore, improvement in GAF scores for 10\\xa0kHz SCS  2038   Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035â2044 1 3 group was higher than that reported in the traditional SCS  group (difference in medians: 5.00, [95% CI 0.10â10.00],  p < .01, MannâWhitney test). The specific distribution of  subjects among subcategories has been previously reported  [29]. Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SFâMPQâ2) Compared to their respective baseline values, both tradi- tional SCS and 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects reported reductions  in all components of pain and affective disorder subscales  on the SF-MPQ-2. Comparisons between the two treatment  groups at 12\\xa0months revealed that 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects  reported greater improvements than their traditional SCS  counterparts in continuous (difference in medians: 1.17,  [95% CI 2.00â0.50], p < .005), intermittent (difference  in medians: 1.33, [95% CI 2.00â0.50], p < .005), and  neuropathic pain (difference in medians: 0.83, [95% CI  1.50â0.17], p < .01, MannâWhitney non-parametric test).  However, there was no difference between the treatment  groups on the affective disorders subscale (Fig.\\xa02, dif- ference in medians: 0.25, [95% CI 0.00â0.75], p = .080,  MannâWhitney non-parametric test). Fig. 1  Distribution of subjects  amongst the subcategories  of Oswestry Disability Index  (ODI) in the traditional SCS and  10\\xa0kHz SCS groups at baseline  and at 12 months Table 1  The number and percentage of subjects stratified into âminimal,â âmoderate,â âsevere,â âcrippledâ, or âbedboundâ categories by the  ODI administered at baseline and 12\\xa0months The number of subjects who improved from baseline are in normal font, the number with no change from baseline are in Italics, and the number  who worsened are in bold.

Both  the traditional and 10\\xa0kHz SCS groups showed improve- ment from baseline in their PCS and MCS (Fig.\\xa03). In PCS,  the differences in medians for 10\\xa0kHz SCS and traditional  SCS were 7.97 [95% CI 5.72â10.39] and 6.20 [95% CI  3.70â8.78], respectively. In MCS, the differences in medi- ans for 10\\xa0kHz SCS and traditional SCS were 3.77 [95%  CI 0.13â7.53] and 2.10 [95% CI 1.26â5.55], respectively.  There was no statistical difference between the groups in  either score. Global Impression of\\xa0Change (GIC) On the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) question- naire collected at 12\\xa0months, 42.0% of traditional SCS subjects  reported feeling âbetterâ or âa great deal better,â compared  to 57.3% of 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects (Fig.\\xa04A, p = .052, Fisherâs  exact test, 2-sided). On the Clinician Global Impression of  Change (CGIC) questionnaire collected at 12\\xa0months, 56.5%  of traditional SCS subjects were rated by their physician as  âbetterâ or âa great deal better,â compared to 75.0% of 10\\xa0kHz  SCS subjects (Fig.\\xa04B, p = .009, Fisherâs exact test, 2-sided). Sleeping or\\xa0driving with\\xa0stimulation on At 12\\xa0months, 82 of 86, or 95.3%, of the 10\\xa0kHz SCS sub- jects reported leaving the stimulator on while sleeping,  whereas 41 of 69, or 59.4%, of the traditional SCS subjects  did the same (Table\\xa02, p < .001, Fisherâs exact test, 2-sided).  Seventy six of 81, or 93.8%, of the 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects  also reported that they drive with the stimulator turned on,  compared to 40 of 61, or 65.6%, of traditional SCS subjects  who reported doing the same (Table\\xa02, p < .001, Fisherâs  exact test, 2-sided). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI) The PSQI collects data from seven 4-point subscales that  collectively make up the global score. On 6 of the 7 sub- scales, a higher proportion of 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects improved  compared with traditional SCS subjects. The improvement  with 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects was noted to be in subjective  sleep quality, improved sleep latency and duration, better  habitual sleep efficiency, reduced use of sleep medications,  and less daytime dysfunction. A PSQI global score of 5 or  greater indicates poor sleep quality. There was no difference  between the two groups in proportion of âgood sleepersâ  to âpoor sleepersâ at baseline (p = .587, Fisherâs exact test,  2-sided). At 12\\xa0months, there was no increase in the number  of traditional SCS subjects with good sleep quality but there  was an observable increase in the number of âgood sleepersâ  among the 10\\xa0kHz SCS group compared to traditional SCS  subjects (p = .001, Fisherâs exact test, 2-sided). Reliance on\\xa0Patient Remote Programmer At 24\\xa0months, subjects were asked to complete an optional  survey about their use and reliance on their programmer,  including if they took it outside of their homes and if they  used it daily (n = 55 for 10\\xa0kHz SCS and n = 40 for tradi- tional SCS). Approximately 85% of the subjects treated  with traditional SCS, reported carrying their programmer  outside of their homes and 35.4% used their programmers  daily. Only 38.2% of 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects carried the device  with them when they left the house. None of the 10\\xa0kHz SCS  subjects used their remote programming device daily. Discussion When evaluating treatments for chronic, intractable pain,  the paramount focus should be on the magnitude of reduc- tion in pain scores. However, improvement in quality of life  Fig. 2  Average scores at baseline and 12\\xa0months assessed by the SF- MPQ-2. Data are presented as median and interquartile range with  upper and lower bounds for the subscales of continuous pain (A), neu- ropathic pain (B), intermittent pain (C), and affective descriptors (D) 2040   Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035â2044 1 3 metrics may not be neglected, as they add a comprehensive  overview at patientâs overall function and well-being. The  SENZA-RCT not only demonstrated superior pain relief for  10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects with chronic low-back and leg pain  compared to subjects treated with traditional SCS [29], but it  also demonstrated greater improvements across a variety of  QoL measures, including the ODI, GAF, SF-MPQ-2, GIC,  PSQI, and subject remote programmer usage. One assay, the SF-12, showed improvements from  baseline, but did not statistically differ between the two  treatment groups. This instrument is designed to meas- ure QoL and functionality in a wide variety of patient  populations and may lack the sensitivity to detect a differ- ence between the SENZA-RCT treatment groups [40]. In  addition, the SENZA-RCT was powered for the primary  endpoint of responder rates and not the secondary, QoL  endpoints. Thus, a larger sample size may be necessary to  detect differences on the SF-12 questionnaire. Similarly,  this study was not powered to detect differences in sleep  quality as measured by the PSQI, although we do see a  notable increase in the number of 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects at  12\\xa0months who score in the âgood sleeperâ category on the  global scale, while there was no change for traditional SCS  subjects. A larger sample size may help elucidate which  Fig. 3  Subject well-being  as captured at baseline and  the 12-month follow-up with  the SF-12 questionnaire and  reported as two separate sub- scale scores: a physical health  composite score (PCS) and a  mental health composite score  (MCS) 2041 Quality of Life Research (2018) 27:2035â2044  1 3 specific aspects of sleep quality improve for 10\\xa0kHz SCS  subjects. It is noteworthy that this scale has been shown  to correlate strongly with measures of depression, anxiety,  stress, and a negative outlook [41, 42]. Traditional SCS subjects reported much higher daily  usage of their programmers and were more likely to carry  it with them than subjects being treated with 10\\xa0kHz SCS.  This suggests that those being treated with 10\\xa0kHz were  less burdened by the needs of the therapy. It is possible that  the uncomfortable paresthesia reported in the traditional  SCS group could have attributed to this behavior. Majority  (95.5%) of subjects receiving traditional SCS experienced  paresthesia and of those, 11.1% found it uncomfortable and  39.7% experienced discomfort with changes in posture. The  uncomfortable paresthesia elicited by traditional SCS could  also explain the difference in device usage (10\\xa0kHz SCS:  24 Â± 0.1\\xa0h/day versus traditional SCS: 17.0 Â± 7.3\\xa0h/day). Another concept which may help interpret clinical out- comes and simplify treatment algorithms would be to estab- lish what constitutes a minimal clinically important differ- ence (MCID) for a variety of measures commonly used in  chronic pain research. MCID is defined as âThe smallest dif- ference in score in the domain of interest which patients per- ceive as beneficial and which would mandate, in the absence  of troublesome side effects and excessive cost, a change  in the patientâs managementâ [43]. Few studies assessing  SCS therapy have examined MCID in functional and QoL  outcomes. Defining MCID threshold for QoL assessments  would help identify what level of score improvement an  intervention is of noticeable benefit to the patient; therefore,  potentially worth the attendant risks. For the ODI, several  studies have defined a range of absolute value changes in  the overall score as an MCID [44â48]. An analysis of the  SENZA-RCT ODI data per the MCID definitions estab- lished in these studies demonstrate the responder rates for  both traditional SCS and 10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects at 12\\xa0months  which is depicted in Fig.\\xa05. Regardless of how conservative  the definition of the MCID is, approximately 10â15% more  10\\xa0kHz SCS subjects achieved an MCID than their tradi- tional SCS counterparts. Presenting the data in this manner,  as the proportion of subjects who report a MCID from their  baseline score, will provide a standard by which a physician  can evaluate the clinical significance of an improved score.  Further research to establish MCID thresholds for additional  QoL assessments would be of tremendous value. Fig. 4  The percentage of subjects categorized into âa great deal bet- ter,â âbetter,â âmoderately better,â âsomewhat better,â âa little bet- ter,â âalmost the same,â or âno changeâ by the GIC administered at  12\\xa0months. This assessment is completed by both the patient (PGIC,  A) and the clinician (CGIC, B). The total percentage of subjects  whose change from baseline was classified as either âa great deal bet- terâ or âbetterâ is indicated next to each bar Table 2  Subject device usage while sleeping or driving Results of subject questionnaire at 12\\xa0months about SCS use during  sleep and while driving.

Results presented here  further demonstrate that 10\\xa0kHz SCS markedly improves  secondary outcomes that reflect the subjectsâ better health,  functionality, and overall well-being. The higher subject  satisfaction scores could be due to the absence of paresthe- sias with 10\\xa0kHz SCS and/or the superior, stable pain relief.  Based on the available data, it is reasonable to postulate that  a high degree of pain relief, in the absence of paresthesias,  enables the subjects to carry out daily activities, including  driving and sleeping, without experiencing unwanted stim- ulation from postural changes, a common complaint with  traditional low-frequency SCS systems [50, 51]. A limitation of the study was that these tertiary endpoints  were not powered to assess multiple hypothesis tests. Other  study limitations include the subjects and the investigators  not being masked to the assigned treatment group and the  heterogeneity of pain diagnoses, as previously discussed  [23]. The SENZA-RCT not only demonstrated sustainably  improved pain scores with 10\\xa0kHz SCS, but it also improved  measures related to quality of life in a clinically meaning- ful manner, superior to traditional SCS for this given pain  patient population.
